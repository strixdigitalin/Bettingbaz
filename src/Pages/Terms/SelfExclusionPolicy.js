        If you feel you are at risk of developing a gambling problem or believe
        you currently have a<br />

        Bettingbaaz for a specified period of 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years
        or permanently.

        What happens when you self-exclude?
        <br />
        During a period of Self-Exclusion you will not be able to use your
        account for betting, although
        <br />
        you will still be able to login and withdraw any remaining balance. It
        will not be possible to
        <br />
        re-open your account for any reason, and Bettingbaaz will do all it can
        to detect and close any
        <br />
        new accounts you may open.
        <br />
