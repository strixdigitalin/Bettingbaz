        (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) will be provided to
        <br />

        Please read these terms very carefully as they form a binding legal
        agreement between you -<br />
        our customer (the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo;) - and us. By opening an
        account (the &ldquo;Account&rdquo;) and using the

        General Terms
        <br />
        We reserve the right to amend the terms (including to any documents
        referred and linked to
        <br />
        below) at any time. When such an amendment is not substantial, we may
        not provide you with
        <br />
        prior notice. You will be notified in advance for material changes to
        the terms and may require
        <br />
        you to re-confirm acceptance to the updated terms before the changes
        come into effect. If you
        <br />
        object to any such changes, you must immediately stop using the service
        and the termination
        <br />
        provisions below will apply. Continued use of the service indicates your
        agreement to be bound
        <br />
        by such changes. Any bets not settled prior to the changed terms taking
        effect will be subject to
        <br />
        the pre-existing terms.
        <br />

        right to refuse to accept a registration application from any applicant
        at our sole discretion and

        card) and a recent utility bill listing your name and address as proof
        of residence to the

        minimum. We reserve the right to suspend wagering or restrict Account
        options on any Account
        <br />

        methods set out on the payment section of our Website.
        <br />
        You must provide complete and accurate information about yourself,
        inclusive of a valid name,
        <br />
        surname, address and email address, and update such information in the
        future to keep it
        <br />
        complete and accurate. It is your responsibility to keep your contact
        details up to date on your
        <br />
        account. Failure to do so may result in you failing to receive important
        account related
        <br />
        notifications and information from us, including changes we make to
        these terms. We identify
        <br />

        provide us with the correct
        <br />
        email address and to advise bettingbaaz of any changes in their email
        address. Each Customer
        <br />
        is wholly responsible for maintaining the security of his Registered
        Email Address to prevent the
        <br />
        use of his Registered Email Address by any third party. bettingbaaz
        shall not be responsible for
        <br />
        any damages or losses deemed or alleged to have resulted from
        communications between
        <br />
        bettingbaaz and the Customer using the Registered Email Address. Any
        Customer not having
        <br />
        an email address reachable by bettingbaaz will have his Account
        suspended until such an
        <br />
        address is provided to us. We will immediately suspend your Account upon
        written notice to you
        <br />
        to this effect if you intentionally provide false or inaccurate personal
        information. We may also
        <br />
        take legal action against you for doing so in certain circumstances
        and/or contact the relevant
        <br />
        authorities who may also take action against you.
        <br />
        You are only allowed to register one Account with the service. Accounts
        are subject to
        <br />
        immediate closure if it is found that you have multiple Accounts
        registered with us.
        <br />
        This includes the use of representatives, relatives, associates,
        affiliates, related parties,
        <br />
        connected persons and/ or third parties operating on your behalf.
        <br />
        In order to ensure your financial worthiness and to confirm your
        identity, we may use any third
        <br />
        party information providers we consider necessary.
        <br />
        You must keep your password for the service confidential. Provided that
        the Account information
        <br />
        requested has been correctly supplied, we are entitled to assume that
        bets, deposits and
        <br />
        withdrawals have been made by you. We advise you to change your password
        on a regular
        <br />
        basis and never disclose it to any third party. Passwords must contain
        at least one letter, one
        <br />
        number and one special character and must be at least eight characters
        long. It is your
        <br />
        responsibility to protect your password and any failure to do so shall
        be at your sole risk and
        <br />
        expense. You must log out of the Service at the end of each session. If
        you believe any of your
        <br />
        Account information is being misused by a third party, or your Account
        has been hacked into, or
        <br />
        your password has been discovered by a third party, you must notify us
        immediately by email
        <br />
        using your registered Email Address to support@bettingbaaz.com
        <br />
        You must notify us if your registered email Address has been hacked
        into, we may, however,
        <br />
        require you to provide additional information/ documentation so that we
        can verify your identity.
        <br />
        We will immediately suspend your Account once we are aware of such an
        incident. In the
        <br />
        meantime you are responsible for all activity on your Account including
        third party access,
        <br />
        regardless of whether or not their access was authorized by you.
        <br />
        You must not at any time transmit any content or other information on
        the service to another
        <br />
        Customer or any other party by way of a screen capture (or other similar
        method), nor display
        <br />
        any such information or content in a frame or in any other manner that
        is different from how it
        <br />
        would appear if such Customer or third party had typed the URL for the
        service into the browser
        <br />
        line;
        <br />
        When registering, you will be required to choose the currency in which
        you will operate your
        <br />
        account. This will be the currency of your deposits, withdrawals and
        bets placed and matched
        <br />
        into the service as set out in these terms. Some payment methods do not
        process in all
        <br />
        currencies. In such cases a processing currency will be displayed, along
        with a conversion
        <br />
        calculator available on the page.
        <br />

        an invitation to treat. It is entirely within our sole discretion
        whether or not to proceed with the
        <br />
        opening of an account for you and, should we refuse to open an Account
        for you, we are under
        <br />
        no obligation to provide you with a reason for the refusal.
        <br />
        Upon receipt of your application, we may be in touch to request further
        information and/ or
        <br />
        documentation from you in order for us to comply with our regulatory and
        legal obligations.

        Service or another Customer using the Service; or (ii) collude with any
        other Customer using the

        other currency will be converted using the daily exchange rate obtained
        from www.oanda.com,
        <br />
        or at our own bank&rsquo;s prevailing rate of exchange following which
        your Account will be deposited
        <br />
        accordingly.
        <br />
        Fees and charges may apply to customer&rsquo;s deposits and withdrawals.
        Any deposit made to an
        <br />
        account which is not rolled over (risked) three times will incur a 3%
        processing fee and any
        <br />
        applicable withdrawal fee. You are responsible for your own bank charges
        that you may incur
        <br />
        due to depositing funds with us. Exceptions to this rule are outlined in
        our &ldquo;Payment Options&rdquo;
        <br />
        pages.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz is not a financial institution and uses a third party
        electronic payment processor to
        <br />
        process credit and debit card deposits; they are not processed directly
        by us. If you deposit
        <br />
        funds by either a credit card or a debit card, your Account will only be
        credited if we receive an
        <br />
        approval and authorization code from the payment issuing institution. If
        your card&rsquo;s issuer gives
        <br />
        no such authorisation, your account will not be credited with those
        funds.
        <br />
        Your funds are deposited and held in the respective client account based
        on the currency of
        <br />
        your account.
        <br />
        We are not a financial institution and you will not be entitled to any
        interest on any outstanding
        <br />
        account balances and any interest accrued on the client accounts will be
        paid to us.
        <br />
        Funds originating from ill-gotten means must not be deposited with us.
        <br />
        7. Withdrawal of Funds
        <br />
        You may withdraw any or all of your account Balance within the
        transaction.
        <br />
        Note that fees may apply as outlined in section 7.b.
        <br />
        All withdrawals must be made in the currency of your account, unless
        otherwise stipulated by
        <br />
        us.
        <br />
        We reserve the right to request documentation for the purpose of
        identity verification prior to
        <br />
        granting any withdrawals from your Account. We also reserve our rights
        to request this
        <br />
        documentation at any time during the lifetime of your relationship with
        us.
        <br />
        All withdrawals must be made to the original debit, credit card, bank
        account, method of
        <br />
        payment used to make the payment to your bettingbaaz.com Account. We
        may, and always at
        <br />
        our own discretion, allow you to withdraw to a payment method from which
        your original deposit
        <br />
        did not originate. This will always be subject to additional security
        checks.
        <br />
        Should you wish to withdraw funds but your account is either
        inaccessible, dormant, locked or
        <br />
        closed, please contact our Customer Service Department at
        support@bettingbaaz.com
        <br />
        8. Payment Transactions and Processors
        <br />
        You are fully responsible for paying all monies owed to us. You must
        make all payments to us in
        <br />
        good faith and not attempt to reverse a payment made or take any action
        which will cause such
        <br />
        payment to be reversed by a third party in order to avoid a liability
        legitimately incurred. You will
        <br />
        reimburse us for any charge-backs, denial or reversal of payment you
        make and any loss
        <br />
        suffered by us as a consequence thereof. We reserve the right to also
        impose an administration
        <br />
        fee of &euro;60, or currency equivalent per charge-back, denial or
        reversal of payment you make.
        <br />
        We reserve the right to use third party electronic payment processors
        and or merchant banks to
        <br />
        process payments made by you and you agree to be bound by their terms
        and conditions
        <br />
        providing they are made aware to you and those terms do not conflict
        with these Terms.
        <br />
        All transactions made on our site might be checked to prevent money
        laundering or terrorism
        <br />
        financing activity. Suspicious transactions will be reported to the
        relevant authority depending on
        <br />
        the jurisdiction governing the transaction.
        <br />
        9. Errors
        <br />
        In the event of an error or malfunction of our system or processes, all
        bets are rendered void.
        <br />
        You are under an obligation to inform us immediately as soon as you
        become aware of any error
        <br />
        with the service. In the event of communication or system errors or bugs
        or viruses occurring in
        <br />
        connection with the service and/or payments made to you as a result of a
        defect or effort in the
        <br />
        Service, we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any
        direct or indirect costs,
        <br />
        expenses, losses or claims arising or resulting from such errors, and we
        reserve the right to void
        <br />
        all games/bets in question and take any other action to correct such
        errors.
        <br />
        In the event of a casino system malfunction, or disconnection issues,
        all bets are rendered void.
        <br />
        In the event of such error or any system failure or game error that
        results in an error in any odds
        <br />
        calculation, charges, fees, rake, bonuses or payout, or any currency
        conversion as applicable,
        <br />
        or other casino system malfunction (the &ldquo;Casino Error&rdquo;), we
        reserve the right to declare null and
        <br />
        void any wagers or bets that were the subject of such Casino Error and
        to take any money from
        <br />
        your Account relating to the relevant bets or wagers.
        <br />
        We make every effort to ensure that we do not make errors in posting
        lines. However, if as a<br />
        result of human error or system problems a bet is accepted at an odd
        that is: materially different
        <br />
        from those available in the general market at the time the bet was made;
        or clearly incorrect
        <br />
        given the chance of the event occurring at the time the bet was made
        then we reserve the right
        <br />
        to cancel or void that wager, or to cancel or void a wager made after an
        event has started.
        <br />
        We have the right to recover from you any amount overpaid and to adjust
        your account to rectify
        <br />
        any mistake. An example of such a mistake might be where a price is
        incorrect or where we
        <br />
        enter a result of an event incorrectly. If there are insufficient funds
        in your Account, we may
        <br />
        demand that you pay us the relevant outstanding amount relating to any
        erroneous bets or
        <br />
        wagers. Accordingly, we reserve the right to cancel, reduce or delete
        any pending plays,
        <br />
        whether placed with funds resulting from the error or not.
        <br />
        10. General Rules
        <br />
        If a sport-specific rule contradicts a general rule, then the general
        rule will not apply.
        <br />
        The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the
        event&rsquo;s settlement; we do not
        <br />
        recognise protested or overturned decisions for wagering purposes. The
        result of an event
        <br />
        suspended after the start of competition will be decided according to
        the wagering rules
        <br />
        specified for that sport by us.
        <br />
        All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries will be
        entertained after that period
        <br />
        of time. Within 72 hours after results are posted, the company will only
        reset/correct the results
        <br />
        due to human error, system error or mistakes made by the referring
        results source.
        <br />
        Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events will be
        determined by us and are
        <br />
        subject to change without prior written notice. We also reserve the
        right to adjust limits on
        <br />
        individual Accounts as well.
        <br />
        Customers are solely responsible for their own account transactions.
        Please be sure to review
        <br />
        your wagers for any mistakes before sending them in. Once a transaction
        is complete, it cannot
        <br />
        be changed. We do not take responsibility for missing or duplicate
        wagers made by the
        <br />
        Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is
        missing or duplicated.
        <br />
        Customers may review their transactions in the My Account section of the
        site after each
        <br />
        session to ensure all requested wagers were accepted.
        <br />
        For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No
        Proposition, the contestant
        <br />
        must enter and compete in the event.
        <br />
        We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home and away
        teams by indicating the
        <br />
        home and away team by means of vertical placement on the desktop site
        version. This means
        <br />
        in American Sports we would place the home team on the bottom. For
        Non-US sports, we would
        <br />
        indicate the home team on top. In the case of a neutral venue, we
        attempt to include the letter
        <br />
        &ldquo;N&rdquo; next to the team names to indicate this. For the Asian
        and mobile versions, we do not
        <br />
        distinguish between European and American Sports. On the Asian and
        mobile versions of the
        <br />
        site, the home team is always listed first. However, we do not guarantee
        the accuracy of this
        <br />
        information and unless there is an official venue change subsequent to
        bets being placed, all
        <br />
        wagers have action.
        <br />
        A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading that is
        associated with the
        <br />
        matchup. For example, two teams from the same League are playing in a
        Cup competition. If
        <br />
        the matchup is mistakenly placed in the League offering, the game/match
        will still have action,
        <br />
        as long as the matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup will have
        action as long as the two
        <br />
        teams are correct, and regardless of the League header in which it is
        placed on our Website.
        <br />
        If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the governing
        body, then all wagers
        <br />
        on the event have no action. If an event is posted by us, with an
        incorrect date, all wagers have
        <br />
        action based on the date announced by the governing body.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz reserves the right to remove events, markets and any other
        product from the
        <br />
        website.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz reserves the right to restrict the casino access of any
        player without prior notice.
        <br />
        In all futures wagering (for example, total season wins, Super Bowl
        winner, etc.), the winner as
        <br />
        determined by the Governing Body will also be declared the winner for
        betting purposes except
        <br />
        when the minimum number of games required for the future to have
        &ldquo;action&rdquo; has not been
        <br />
        completed.
        <br />
        11. Communications and Notices
        <br />
        All communications and notices to be given under these terms by you to
        us shall be sent to
        <br />
        support@bettingbaaz.com
        <br />
        All communications and notices to be given under these terms by us to
        you shall, unless
        <br />
        otherwise specified in these terms, be either posted on the Website
        and/or sent to the
        <br />
        Registered Email Address we hold on our system for the relevant
        Customer. The method of
        <br />
        such communication shall be in our sole and exclusive discretion.
        <br />
        All communications and notices to be given under these terms by either
        you or us shall be in
        <br />
        writing in the English language when the service is not operated by
        bettingbaaz, and must be
        <br />
        given to and from the Registered Email Address in your Account.
        <br />
        12. Matters Beyond Our Control
        <br />
        We cannot be held liable for any failure or delay in providing the
        service due to an event of
        <br />
        Force Majeure which could reasonably be considered to be outside our
        control despite our
        <br />
        execution of reasonable preventative measures such as: an act of God;
        trade or labor dispute;
        <br />
        power cut; act, failure or omission of any government or authority;
        obstruction or failure of
        <br />
        telecommunication services; or any other delay or failure caused by a
        third party, and we will not
        <br />
        be liable for any resulting loss or damage that you may suffer. In such
        an event, we reserve the
        <br />
        right to cancel or suspend the Service without incurring any liability.
        <br />
        13. Liability
        <br />
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE WILL NOT COMPENSATE YOU
        <br />
        FOR ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE LOSS OR DAMAGE (EITHER DIRECT OR
        <br />
        INDIRECT) YOU MAY SUFFER IF WE FAIL TO CARRY OUT OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER
        <br />
        THESE TERMS UNLESS WE BREACH ANY DUTIES IMPOSED ON US BY LAW (INCLUDING
        <br />
        IF WE CAUSE DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY BY OUR NEGLIGENCE) IN WHICH CASE
        <br />
        WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU IF THAT FAILURE IS ATTRIBUTED TO
        <br />
        (I) YOUR OWN FAULT;
        <br />
        (II) A THIRD PARTY UNCONNECTED WITH OUR PERFORMANCE OF THESE TERMS (FOR
        <br />
        INSTANCE PROBLEMS DUE TO COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK PERFORMANCE,
        <br />
        CONGESTION, AND CONNECTIVITY OR THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR COMPUTER
        <br />
        EQUIPMENT); OR
        <br />
        (III) ANY OTHER EVENTS WHICH NEITHER WE NOR OUR SUPPLIERS COULD HAVE
        <br />
        FORESEEN OR FORESTALLED EVEN IF WE OR THEY HAD TAKEN REASONABLE CARE.
        <br />
        AS THIS SERVICE IS FOR CONSUMER USE ONLY WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
        <br />
        BUSINESS LOSSES OF ANY KIND. IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE HELD LIABLE FOR
        ANY
        <br />
        EVENT UNDER THESE TERMS, OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER OR
        <br />
        IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED
        <br />
        (A) THE VALUE OF THE BETS AND OR WAGERS YOU PLACED VIA YOUR ACCOUNT IN
        <br />
        RESPECT OF THE RELEVANT BET/WAGER OR PRODUCT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE
        <br />
        RELEVANT LIABILITY, OR
        <br />
        (B) EUR &euro;500 IN AGGREGATE, WHICHEVER IS LOWER. WE STRONGLY
        RECOMMEND
        <br />
        THAT YOU (I) TAKE CARE TO VERIFY THE SUITABILITY AND COMPATIBILITY OF
        THE
        <br />
        SERVICE WITH YOUR OWN COMPUTER EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO USE; AND (II) TAKE
        <br />
        REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST HARMFUL PROGRAMS
        <br />
        OR DEVICES INCLUDING THROUGH INSTALLATION OF ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE.
        <br />
        14. Gambling By Those Under Age
        <br />
        If we suspect that you are or receive notification that you are
        currently under 18 years or were
        <br />
        under 18 years (or below the age of majority as stipulated in the laws
        of the jurisdiction
        <br />
        applicable to you) when you placed any bets through the service your
        account will be
        <br />
        suspended to prevent you placing any further bets or making any
        withdrawals from your
        <br />
        account. We will then investigate the matter, including whether you have
        been betting as an
        <br />
        agent for, or otherwise on behalf, of a person under 18 years (or below
        the age of majority as
        <br />
        stipulated in the laws of the jurisdiction applicable to you). If having
        found that you: (a) are
        <br />
        currently; (b) were under 18 years or below the majority age which
        applies to you at the relevant
        <br />
        time; or (c) have been betting as an agent for or at the behest of a
        person under 18 years or
        <br />
        below the majority age which applies:
        <br />
        i. all winnings currently or due to be credited to your account will be
        retained;
        <br />
        ii. all winnings gained from betting through the service whilst under
        age must be paid to us on
        <br />
        demand (if you fail to comply with this provision we will seek to
        recover all costs associated with
        <br />
        recovery of such sums); and/or
        <br />
        iii. any monies deposited in your bettingbaaz.com account which are not
        winnings will be
        <br />
        returned to you.
        <br />
        This condition also applies to you if you are over the age of 18 years
        but you are placing your
        <br />
        bets within a jurisdiction which specifies a higher age than 18 years
        for legal betting and you are
        <br />
        below that legal minimum age in that jurisdiction.
        <br />
        In the event we suspect you are in breach of the provisions of this
        Clause 15 or are attempting
        <br />
        to rely on them for a fraudulent purpose, we reserve the right to take
        any action necessary in
        <br />
        order to investigate the matter, including informing the relevant law
        enforcement agencies.
        <br />
        15. Anti Money-Laundering and KYC Policy
        <br />
        It is the policy of bettingbaaz to actively prevent the services of the
        firm being used to facilitate
        <br />
        financial crime, money laundering and terrorist financing.
        <br />
        Strict compliance with all applicable regulations will also protect the
        senior management and
        <br />
        staff of the firm, as individuals, from the risks of breaches of the
        law, regulations, and
        <br />
        supervisory requirements, and to preserve the reputation of the
        bettingbaazagainst the damage
        <br />
        that could be caused by being implicated in money laundering and
        terrorist financing activities.
        <br />
        To achieve these objectives, it is the policy of this firm that:

        <br />
        A commitment to &ldquo;knowing its customer&rdquo; appropriately - both
        at acceptance and throughout the
        <br />

        Member State or in that of a<br />
        third country.
        <br />
        Terrorism financing means the provision or collection of funds, by any

        <br />
        bettingbaaz has appointed a MLRO with full responsibility for
        bettingbaaz&rsquo;s anti-money
        <br />

        <br />
        The MLRO:
        <br />
        Will monitor the day-to-day operation of bettingbaaz TRADING&rsquo;s
        AML/CFT policies and respond

        enforcement agencies, in
        <br />
        order that any suspicious activity may be reported to the right quarter
        as soon as is practicable.
        <br />
        Has the authority and the resources necessary to discharge their
        responsibilities effectively.
        <br />
        Is from a senior level and has direct access to senior management and
        the board of directors.
        <br />
        May choose to delegate certain duties to other employees, but wherever
        such a delegation is
        <br />
        made, the MLRO retains ultimate responsibility for the implementation of
        the compliance
        <br />
        regime.
        <br />
        At least annually, the MLRO will issue a report (the MLRO Report) to the
        senior management of
        <br />
        bettingbaaz on the operation and effectiveness of the money laundering
        controls. This report will
        <br />
        cover improvements, remedial programmes, the outcome of any internal
        audit reviews of the
        <br />
        AML/CFT processes, and other relevant items.
        <br />
        15.4 Compliance Policies and Procedures
        <br />
        bettingbaaz has policies and procedures to assess the risks related to
        money laundering and
        <br />
        terrorist financing. These policies and procedures are:
        <br />
        Written and maintained by the MLRO under the supervision of senior
        management
        <br />
        Approved by senior management
        <br />
        Communicated, understood and adhered to by everyone dealing with
        customers or their
        <br />
        transactions, including those who work in the areas relating to customer
        identification, record
        <br />
        keeping, and reportable transactions, who need enough information to
        process and complete a<br />
        transaction properly as well as to ascertain the identity of customers
        and keep records as
        <br />
        required.
        <br />
        Policies and procedures which incorporate the reporting, record keeping,
        customer
        <br />
        identification, risk assessment and risk mitigation requirements
        applicable.
        <br />
        Although directors and senior officers may not be involved in day-to-day
        compliance, they need
        <br />
        to understand the statutory duties placed upon them, their staff and
        bettingbaaz itself.
        <br />
        15.4.1 The Risk-Based Approach
        <br />
        In money laundering and terrorist financing, a risk-based approach
        covers the following:
        <br />
        The risk assessment of customer relationships and business activities;
        <br />
        The risk mitigation to implement controls to handle identified risks;
        <br />
        Keeping customer identification, beneficial ownership and business
        relationship information up
        <br />
        to date; and
        <br />
        The ongoing monitoring of business relationships and transactions.
        <br />
        Existing regulatory obligations, such as for customer identification,
        are a minimum baseline
        <br />
        requirement. Where enhanced due diligence is appropriate, a principle of
        the risk-based
        <br />
        approach is to focus resources where they are most needed to manage
        risks within our
        <br />
        tolerance level.
        <br />
        15.4.2 Risk Mitigation
        <br />
        Risk mitigation is implementing controls to limit the potential money
        laundering and terrorist
        <br />
        financing risks identified in the risk assessment so as to stay within
        the risk tolerance level.
        <br />
        When the risk assessment determines that risk is high for money
        laundering or terrorist
        <br />
        financing, then we will develop risk mitigation strategies and apply
        them.
        <br />
        In all situations, risk mitigation controls and measures include:
        <br />
        Focussing on operations (products and services, customers and business
        relationships,
        <br />
        geographic locations, and any other relevant factors) that are more
        vulnerable to abuse by
        <br />
        money launderers and criminals;
        <br />
        Informing senior management of compliance initiatives, identified
        compliance deficiencies,
        <br />
        corrective action taken, and suspicious transaction reports filed;
        <br />
        Providing for program continuity despite changes in management,
        employees or structure;
        <br />
        Focussing on meeting all regulatory record keeping and reporting
        requirements,
        <br />
        recommendations for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
        compliance and
        <br />
        providing for timely updates in response to changes in requirements;
        <br />
        Enabling the timely identification of reportable transactions and ensure
        accurate filing of
        <br />
        required reports;
        <br />
        Incorporating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
        compliance into job descriptions
        <br />
        and performance evaluations of appropriate personnel; and
        <br />
        Providing for adequate supervision and training of employees that handle
        currency transactions,
        <br />
        complete reports, monitor for suspicious transactions, or engage in any
        other activity that forms
        <br />
        part of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing program.
        <br />
        Increasing awareness of high risk situations within all business lines;
        <br />
        Increasing the frequency of ongoing monitoring of transactions or
        business relationships;
        <br />
        Escalating the approval of the establishment of an account or
        relationship even if not otherwise
        <br />
        required to do so;
        <br />
        Increasing the levels of ongoing controls and reviews of relationships;
        <br />
        Requesting high-risk customers provide additional, documented
        information regarding controls
        <br />
        they have implemented to safeguard their operations from abuse by money
        launderers and
        <br />
        terrorists;
        <br />
        Verifying the identity of customers by reference to reliable,
        independent source documents, data
        <br />
        or information;
        <br />
        Preventing any transaction with a potential customer until
        identification and account opening
        <br />
        information has been obtained;
        <br />
        Implementing an appropriate process to approve all relationships
        identified as high-risk as part
        <br />
        of the customer acceptance process or declining to do business with
        potential customers
        <br />
        because they exceed bettingbaaz&rsquo;s risk tolerance level;
        <br />
        Implementing a process to exit from an existing high-risk relationship
        which management sees
        <br />
        as exceeding bettingbaaz&rsquo;s risk tolerance level.
        <br />
        15.4.3 Risk Assessment
        <br />
        bettingbaaz is required to and will analyse potential threats and
        vulnerabilities to money
        <br />
        laundering and terrorist financing to which the business may be exposed
        to in a risk
        <br />
        assessment.
        <br />
        The risk assessment will document and consider the following:
        <br />
        Products, services and delivery channels
        <br />
        Geographic locations and areas of operation
        <br />
        Customers
        <br />
        The risk assessment may identify high-risk situations for which risk
        mitigation controls and
        <br />
        monitoring may be required. The risk assessment is not static and will
        change over time.
        <br />
        When a customer is identified as high-risk, they are subject to more
        frequent ongoing monitoring
        <br />
        and updating of customer identification information, as well as any
        other appropriate enhanced
        <br />
        measures.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz shall perform an initial risk assessment at the beginning of
        a new customer
        <br />
        relationship and for existing customers on an ongoing basis.
        <br />
        15.5 Client and Business Risk
        <br />
        15.5.1 Products, Services and Delivery Channels
        <br />
        bettingbaaz will identify products and services or combinations of them
        that may pose an
        <br />
        elevated risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. For example,
        products and services that
        <br />
        support the movement and conversion of assets into, through and out of
        the financial system
        <br />
        pose a high risk. Certain services have also been identified by
        financial regulators,
        <br />
        governmental authorities or other credible sources as being potentially
        high-risk for money
        <br />
        laundering or terrorist financing.
        <br />
        Wire transactions;
        <br />
        Transactions involving third parties;
        <br />
        Non-face-to-face business relationships.
        <br />
        15.5.2 Geographic Locations and Areas of Operation
        <br />
        Certain geographic locations potentially pose an elevated risk for money
        laundering and terrorist
        <br />
        financing. These have been described by the FATF and by other resources
        such as
        <br />
        Transparency International.
        <br />
        Clients from, or identified as linked to these countries will be
        regarded as high risk:
        <br />
        Any country subject to sanctions, embargoes, or similar measures;
        <br />
        Any country identified by credible sources as providing funding or
        support for terrorist activities,
        <br />
        or that have designated terrorist organisations operating within their
        country;
        <br />
        Any country known to be a tax haven, source of narcotics or other
        significant criminal activity;
        <br />
        Any country identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as
        non-cooperative in the fight
        <br />
        against money laundering or terrorist financing or subject to a FATF
        statement;
        <br />
        Any country identified by credible sources as lacking appropriate money
        laundering or terrorist
        <br />
        financing laws and regulations, or as having significant levels of
        corruption.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz does not do business with or provide services to anyone in
        any country belonging to
        <br />
        a list of select countries subject to comprehensive international
        sanctions.
        <br />
        15.5.3 Customer Relationships
        <br />
        The risk assessment requires you to know your customers
        (&ldquo;KYC&rdquo;). This is not limited to
        <br />
        identification or
        <br />
        record keeping, but it is also about understanding the customers &ndash;
        including their activities,
        <br />
        transaction patterns, and how they operate.
        <br />
        Examples of the factors that will be considered are:
        <br />
        How long we have known the customer and had a business relationship;
        <br />
        Customers wanting to carry out large transactions;
        <br />
        Customers with regulatory or enforcement issues;
        <br />
        Customers with multiple online complaints;
        <br />
        Customers whose identification is difficult to verify;
        <br />
        Customers who are politically exposed.
        <br />
        Each customer is risk-rated as either posing a low, medium or high risk
        of money laundering
        <br />
        and/or
        <br />
        terrorist financing. The rating given at the beginning of the business
        relationship may be
        <br />
        adjusted
        <br />
        after the re-assessment and may change over time. The level of customer
        due diligence will
        <br />
        vary
        <br />
        depending on the risk rating of the customer at the beginning of the
        relationship and as it
        <br />
        changes.
        <br />
        For all high-risk players, enhanced due diligence is applied right away.
        <br />
        15.5.4 Regulatory risk
        <br />
        Regulatory risk means not meeting our obligations under applicable
        legislation. Examples of
        <br />
        breaches of regulatory obligations include:
        <br />
        Customer identification not done properly;
        <br />
        Failure to train staff adequately;
        <br />
        Bot having an anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing
        (AML/CFT) program;
        <br />
        Failure to report suspicious transactions;
        <br />
        Not having an MLRO;
        <br />
        Failing to keep complete customer records.
        <br />
        15.5 Compliance Training
        <br />
        bettingbaaz has a training program for all relevant employees and other
        individuals who act on
        <br />
        behalf of the Company. The goal of this training is to make sure that
        those who have contact
        <br />
        with customers, who see customer transaction activity or who handle
        funds in any way
        <br />
        understand the reporting, customer identification and record keeping
        requirements.
        <br />
        All new employees of bettingbaaz are required to complete anti-money
        laundering and terrorist
        <br />
        financing compliance training within their first three months of
        employment, and for
        <br />
        customer-facing staff training is delivered prior to dealing with
        customers.
        <br />
        Training is currently conducted through a customized course. The
        training program is delivered
        <br />
        electronically (via a learning management system). The training program
        is reviewed and
        <br />
        updated by the MLRO to reflect requirements as they change. The
        compliance training includes
        <br />
        a test which everyone must pass in order to consider their training
        complete.
        <br />
        To ensure employee training is kept up to date, all existing employees
        will receive follow up
        <br />
        training on new and existing AML and regulatory requirements on a
        regular basis (at least within
        <br />
        one year of their last training). If the online training test results
        show that a staff member does
        <br />
        not understand the training material, bettingbaaz will ensure that the
        staff member receives
        <br />
        specialized one-on-one training to understand the material.
        <br />
        An employee log of assigned and completed training materials is kept by
        the MLRO and the
        <br />
        Human Resources department for administrative purposes. Retention of
        these records is for a<br />
        period of five years.
        <br />
        Compliance training is adjusted in accordance to the employee&rsquo;s
        role within the company. The
        <br />
        MLRO will review functions and arrange to provide suitable and
        customized training.
        <br />
        Our training will include at a minimum:
        <br />
        An understanding of the reporting, customer identification and record
        keeping requirements as
        <br />
        well as penalties for not meeting those requirements;
        <br />
        Making all employees aware of the internal policies and procedures for
        deterring and detecting
        <br />
        money laundering and terrorist financing that are associated with their
        jobs;
        <br />
        Delivering to employees and suppliers a clear understanding of their
        responsibilities under these
        <br />
        policies and procedures;
        <br />
        All those who have contact with customers, who see customer transaction
        activity, who handle
        <br />
        cash or funds in any way or who are responsible for implementing or
        overseeing the compliance
        <br />
        regime must understand the reporting, customer identification and record
        keeping requirements.
        <br />
        Making all employees aware of how bettingbaaz is vulnerable to abuse by
        criminals laundering
        <br />
        the proceeds of crime or by terrorists financing their activities;
        <br />
        Making all employees and agents aware that they cannot disclose that
        they have made a<br />
        suspicious transaction report, or disclose the contents of such a
        report, with the intent to
        <br />
        prejudice a criminal investigation, whether it has started or not;
        <br />
        That all employees and agents understanding that no criminal or civil
        proceedings may be
        <br />
        brought against them for making a report in good faith;
        <br />
        Background information on money laundering so everyone who needs to can
        understand what
        <br />
        money laundering is, why criminals choose to launder money and how the
        process usually
        <br />
        works;
        <br />
        Details of what terrorist financing is and how that process usually
        works.
        <br />
        The MLRO is responsible for ensuring that everyone is informed of
        changes in anti-money
        <br />
        laundering or anti-terrorist financing legislation, policies and
        procedures, and current
        <br />
        developments in money laundering or terrorist activity financing schemes
        particularly relevant to
        <br />
        their jobs.
        <br />
        Certain employees, such as those in compliance, customer services and
        operations, require
        <br />
        types of specialized additional training which will be provided either
        through external services or
        <br />
        internally. The training program is reviewed and updated to reflect
        changes in requirements.
        <br />
        15.6. Minimum standards &ndash; KYC POLICY
        <br />
        bettingbaaz has established standards regarding Know-Your-Customer
        (&ldquo;KYC&rdquo;). These
        <br />
        standards require due diligence on each prospective customer before
        entering into a business
        <br />
        relationship via identification and verification of his identity and, as
        the case may be, his
        <br />
        representatives and beneficial owners on the basis of documents, data or
        information obtained
        <br />
        from a reliable and independent source compliant with the domestic and
        European AML/CFT
        <br />
        legislation and regulation.
        <br />
        Interpretation of the KYC principle begins with identification of the
        customer by means of the
        <br />
        necessary identification documents.
        <br />
        That identification, completed by other information gathered, enables
        the Customer Acceptance
        <br />
        Policy to be applied.
        <br />
        In addition to these objective criteria, there are subjective elements
        which may arouse
        <br />
        suspicions regarding a customer and to which particular attention should
        be paid.
        <br />
        Finally, as KYC does not involve static data, but dynamic data through
        the relationship with the
        <br />
        customer, it also needs follow-up and ongoing monitoring of the
        customer.
        <br />
        15.6.1. Customer identification and verification (KYC)
        <br />
        The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial
        relations is a vital element, both
        <br />
        for the regulations relating to money laundering and for the KYC policy.
        <br />
        This identification relies on the following fundamental principles :
        <br />
        Each customer (= each individual person and/or each person involved in
        the case of a legal
        <br />
        entity) must be identified by means of original supporting documents.
        <br />
        These documents will be recorded in a centralized system.
        <br />
        The identification must be completed by &quot;face-to-face&quot;
        contact.
        <br />
        Distance identification is also authorized and possible within a
        dedicated acceptance process,
        <br />
        but limits the opportunity to carry out certain transactions or to
        access certain products.
        <br />
        Each person identified must be registered by IT means.
        <br />
        A person will not be accepted as a customer if the identification
        process proves to be
        <br />
        incomplete.
        <br />
        The specific case of the due diligence exercised on the acceptance of
        politically exposed
        <br />
        persons (PEP).
        <br />
        Concrete application at bettingbaaz is reflected by a specific
        identification procedure for
        <br />
        customers referenced as PEP, whatever their place of residence.
        <br />
        15.6.2. Risk Profile calculation
        <br />
        To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to be
        exercised with regard to the
        <br />
        Customer, a &ldquo;Compliance&rdquo; risk profile is calculated first of
        all on entry into relations (Low,
        <br />
        Medium, High), and is then recalculated daily.
        <br />
        15.6.3. Customer acceptance policy
        <br />
        15.6.3.1. Customer Identification
        <br />
        Client Identification is intended to confirm the existence and identify
        the individual with which
        <br />
        bettingbaaz has a business relationship and obtain supporting identity
        information. This includes
        <br />
        measures to:
        <br />
        Confirm the existence of the individual through identification
        documents;
        <br />
        Conduct due diligence into the identity of the customer including:
        <br />
        Cross-referencing customer names against government watch lists;
        <br />
        Determining whether the customers are politically exposed persons;
        <br />
        Determining whether any third parties are involved;
        <br />
        Reviewing relevant publicly available information on the customer (e.g.
        adverse media, social
        <br />
        media);
        <br />
        Reviewing their background, reputation;
        <br />
        Keep records of all information and documents obtained.
        <br />
        15.6.3.2. Identifying Information for Customers
        <br />
        This section sets out the standard identification requirements for
        individuals who have entered
        <br />
        into a business relationship with bettingbaaz. This outline is likely to
        be sufficient for most
        <br />
        situations. If, however, the customer is assessed as presenting a higher
        money laundering or
        <br />
        terrorist financing risk, in line with our identified risk matrix, then
        bettingbaaz requires additional
        <br />
        identity information to be provided and increase the level or
        verification accordingly.
        <br />
        Where the result of the standard verification check gives rise to
        concern or uncertainty over
        <br />
        identity, the number of matches that will be required to be reasonably
        satisfied as to the
        <br />
        individual&rsquo;s identity will increase. Any concerns must be reported
        to the MLRO.
        <br />
        If a customer is unable to produce a primary ID, the reasons for this
        should be noted and they
        <br />
        may not be able to maintain an account.
        <br />
        All documentary evidence must be recent.
        <br />
        Passports and drivers&rsquo; licenses should be valid and not expired
        <br />
        Utility bills should be dated within the last 3 months
        <br />
        In terms of beneficial ownership, we will ask every customer whether
        they are acting in their own
        <br />
        capacity or on behalf of another person. If they are acting for another
        person then we will
        <br />
        require details of such.
        <br />
        Sources of evidence
        <br />
        Proof of Identity - Acceptable photo identity:
        <br />
        Valid passport; or
        <br />
        Valid photo card driving license (full or provisional); or
        <br />
        National identity card (non-UK nationals issued by EEA member states and
        Switzerland); or
        <br />
        Identity card issued by the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland
        <br />
        Proof of Identity - Acceptable non-photo evidence of identity:
        <br />
        Documents issued by a government department, incorporating the
        person&rsquo;s name and
        <br />
        residential address or their date of birth. E.g. (for proof of address
        or date of birth):
        <br />
        Instrument of a court appointment (such as a grant of probate,
        bankruptcy); or
        <br />
        Current council tax demand letter or statement; or
        <br />
        Current (within the last 3 months) bank statements, or credit/debit card
        statements issued by a<br />
        regulated financial sector firm in the UK, EU or equivalent
        jurisdiction; or
        <br />
        A recent (last available) utility bill (gas, water, electricity,
        telephone); it must be a bill or
        <br />
        statement of account (not correspondence); statements printed off the
        internet are not
        <br />
        acceptable on their own (a secondary check will be required such as a
        reference to a telephone
        <br />
        directory including an online telephone directory); or
        <br />
        Valid photo card driving license (full or provisional); or
        <br />
        A solicitor&rsquo;s letter confirming recent house purchase or land
        previous address.
        <br />
        When accepting evidence of identity from a customer, it is important
        that we make sufficient
        <br />
        checks on the evidence provided to satisfy us of the customer&rsquo;s
        identity, and that we keep a<br />
        record of the checks made. This will be done by the MLRO or under the
        supervision of the
        <br />
        MLRO.
        <br />
        Usual checks on photo ID may include:
        <br />
        Likeness against the customer
        <br />
        Does the date of birth on the evidence match the apparent age of the
        customer?
        <br />
        Is the ID valid?
        <br />
        Is the spelling of names the same as other documents provided by the
        customer?
        <br />
        Checks on secondary evidence of ID may include:
        <br />
        Do the addresses match the address given on the photo ID?
        <br />
        Does the name of the customer match with the name on the photo ID?
        <br />
        15.6.3.3. Identity Verification Triggers
        <br />
        Verification of the identity of the customer occurs either when the
        customer has reached the
        <br />
        &euro;2,000 threshold or if the player is considered to be a high-risk
        player upon registration. The
        <br />
        main trigger for Identity Verification is considered a single
        transaction (or smaller, linked
        <br />
        transactions) that reach or exceed &euro;2,000 either at deposit or
        withdrawal stage. For example,
        <br />
        transactions will be considered as linked when they are carried out by
        the same customer
        <br />
        during a single period of being logged on to the bettingbaaz website or
        if they are carried out in
        <br />
        48 hours.
        <br />
        In all cases, the customer will receive a notification to upload
        identity verification documents
        <br />
        listed above. Each document that is provided by customers to bettingbaaz
        is checked manually
        <br />
        by dedicated staff.
        <br />
        Further events that may trigger Identity Verification processes:
        <br />
        When a customer requests a withdrawal to a different account than one
        that was used to make
        <br />
        a deposit (e.g. due to the fact that certain payment service providers
        do not support incoming
        <br />
        payments or other reasons). In these cases, the withdrawal requests will
        be immediately
        <br />
        deducted from the customer&rsquo;s account, however, will not be
        processed until the customer&rsquo;s
        <br />
        identity has been verified to ensure that the funds are going to the
        right person;
        <br />
        When a customer makes multiple deposits within a short timeframe (five
        or more deposits in one
        <br />
        hour);
        <br />
        Staff identifies suspicious deposit patterns and or several payment
        cards are used (three or
        <br />
        more different payment methods used within one week);
        <br />
        Registration country and IP do not match &ndash; In such cases, the
        player account may not be
        <br />
        blocked and the player may still make deposits and play games, however,
        no withdrawal will be
        <br />
        allowed until verification has been carried out;
        <br />
        When a deposit exceeds &euro;5,000.
        <br />
        Copies will be kept of all the documents used for identification.
        <br />
        15.6.3.4. Additional Documents
        <br />
        Additional documents may be requested from customers to substantiate
        their activities or to
        <br />
        better understand their patterns:
        <br />
        Proof of Bank Account &ndash; This may be a screenshot or copy of the
        bank statement stating the
        <br />
        customer&rsquo;s name and IBAN and the name of the bank (for instances
        when a customer requests
        <br />
        a withdrawal to be deposited to a bank account);
        <br />
        Proof of Payment Card &ndash; This may be a photo or copy of the front
        side of the card in question or
        <br />
        a bank statement that will include both the card details and the name of
        the customer (for
        <br />
        instances when suspicious deposit patterns are identified) &ndash;
        <br />
        To protect the customer&rsquo;s card data, bettingbaaz informs them that
        they may obfuscate some of
        <br />
        the card details, however, the customer&rsquo;s name, as well as the
        first and last four digits of the
        <br />
        card number must be visible.
        <br />
        Bank Statements and Payslips &ndash; These may be requested from
        customers displaying potentially
        <br />
        problematic gambling patterns and when external information available on
        the customer does
        <br />
        not validate the amounts being gambled. In such cases bettingbaaz would
        ask its higher volume
        <br />
        customers for documents which would support the funds being spent on
        gambling.
        <br />
        15.6.3.5.Mitigation of Impersonation Risk
        <br />
        Various additional customer identity checks are permitted on a
        risk-based approach. These
        <br />
        checks may include:
        <br />
        Requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the
        customer&rsquo;s name with an
        <br />
        EU/EEA regulated credit institution or one from an equivalent
        jurisdiction;
        <br />
        Verifying additional aspects of the customer&rsquo;s identity, or of
        their electronic &lsquo;footprint&rsquo;;
        <br />
        Telephone contact with the customer prior to opening the account on a
        home or business
        <br />
        number which has been verified (electronically or otherwise) or a call
        to the customer before
        <br />
        further transactions are permitted, using it to verify additional
        aspects of personal identity
        <br />
        information that have been previously provided during the setting up of
        the account;
        <br />
        15.6.3.6. Keeping Information Up-to-Date
        <br />
        Once the identity of a customer has been confirmed, it does not have to
        be confirmed again.
        <br />
        However, if there is any doubt about the information held, then that
        identification will be obtained
        <br />
        again, including the identification of the customer.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz may review the customer documentation and then update it as
        appropriate. Any
        <br />
        changes to identification such as a change of name of the customer would
        require new
        <br />
        documents to be obtained.
        <br />
        15.6.4. Ongoing transaction monitoring
        <br />
        There are certain automated controls in place to monitor customer
        activities, for example:
        <br />
        First time deposits;
        <br />
        Cash-out alerts for cash-outs greater than &euro;1,000;
        <br />
        Activity alerts when customer pays to, or stakes with the casino
        &euro;2,000 during any period of 24
        <br />
        hours;
        <br />
        Credit Card BIN alerts (when Credit Card country differs from player
        account country/IP);
        <br />
        In addition, all cash-out requests are processed manually by the
        Payments Team and are
        <br />
        reviewed on a daily basis. Every request undergoes security checks
        before approval in order to
        <br />
        determine that the origin of the funds/wins is compliant with the Gaming
        Control Board Curacao
        <br />
        Policy and the terms and conditions of the Company.
        <br />
        15.7. Organization of internal control
        <br />
        Any member of bettingbaaz can report suspicious activities to the MLRO,
        as bettingbaaz&rsquo;s
        <br />
        Nominated Officer. A suspicious activity is one where it is known, or
        suspected, there are
        <br />
        reasonably grounds to know or suspect that a person is engaged in, or
        attempting, money
        <br />
        laundering or terrorist financing.
        <br />
        15.7.1. Suspicious transactions reporting
        <br />
        Having knowledge means knowing something to be true. Knowledge can be
        inferred from the
        <br />
        surrounding circumstances; so, for example, a failure to ask obvious
        questions may imply
        <br />
        knowledge. The knowledge must, however, have come to bettingbaaz during
        the course of
        <br />
        business, or from a disclosure (to the MLRO).
        <br />
        Suspicion is more subjective and falls short of proof based on firm
        evidence. Suspicion is more
        <br />
        than speculation and is based on some foundation.
        <br />
        An unusual transaction is not necessarily suspicious. Unusual patterns
        of gambling, including
        <br />
        the spending of particularly large amounts of money in relation to the
        casino or customer&rsquo;s
        <br />
        profile, should receive attention, but unusual behavior should not
        necessarily lead to grounds for
        <br />
        knowledge or suspicion of money laundering, or the making of a report to
        the FIAU. The MLRO
        <br />
        is required to assess all of the circumstances and, in some cases, it
        may be helpful to ask the
        <br />
        customer or others more questions. The choice depends on what is already
        known about the
        <br />
        customer and the transaction, and how easy it is to make enquiries.
        <br />
        Members of staff who consider a transaction or activity to be
        suspicious, would not necessarily
        <br />
        be expected to know or to establish the exact nature of any underlying
        criminal offence, or that
        <br />
        the particular funds or property were those arising from a crime, money
        laundering or terrorist
        <br />
        financing. &ldquo;Reasonable grounds to know or suspect&rdquo;
        introduces an objective test of suspicion.
        <br />
        The test is likely to be met when there are facts or circumstances,
        known to the member of staff,
        <br />
        from which a reasonable person (in a payments firm) would have inferred
        knowledge, or formed
        <br />
        the suspicion, that another person was engaged in money laundering or
        terrorist financing.
        <br />
        A defense of failing to meet the test of suspicion, would be for staff
        to demonstrate that they
        <br />
        took reasonable steps to know the customer and the rationale for the
        transaction, activity or
        <br />
        instruction.
        <br />
        15.7.2 How to Make a Suspicious Activity Report
        <br />
        Any member of staff, who is suspicious that a transaction may involve
        money laundering or who
        <br />
        becomes aware during the course of their work that someone else is
        involved in money
        <br />
        laundering, must make a disclosure to the MLRO using the bettingbaaz
        Suspicious Transaction
        <br />
        Report form.
        <br />
        Once completed, the form should be printed off. The member of staff
        making the report must
        <br />
        sign and date the form before giving it to the MLRO. The MLRO will take
        note of the date and
        <br />
        time of the report receipt.
        <br />
        Upon receipt of the form by the MLRO, they will then decide what is to
        be done as a result of the
        <br />
        report, e.g., whether the matter must be reported to Gaming Control
        board, Curacao. or not, or
        <br />
        further enquiries made and record its decision and the reason for it in
        the customer files. The
        <br />
        member of staff concerned must be informed of the decision and the
        reasons for it.
        <br />
        If the matter is to be referred to GCB, the MLRO or a subordinate will
        complete the FIAU report
        <br />
        form and discuss with the reporting member of staff how matters with the
        customer are to be
        <br />
        conducted from that stage. The GCB report form must be signed off by the
        MLRO or the CEO.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz must not proceed with a transaction whilst we await consent
        from the concerned
        <br />
        GCB; it is given 7 working days (not including weekends or bank
        holidays) to consider the
        <br />
        report.
        <br />
        If we hear nothing then we may continue with the transaction but not
        inform the customer about
        <br />
        the report. GCB may give consent to proceed earlier than this time
        limit. They may also refuse
        <br />
        consent in which case they have a further 31 calendar days (including
        weekends or bank
        <br />
        holidays) to further consider the report. After this they must either
        begin proceedings or allow
        <br />
        the transaction to continue.
        <br />
        The MLRO will submit a softcopy version of the report to the GCB. Any
        paper file for each
        <br />
        matter will be kept by the MLRO.
        <br />
        There must be no record on the customer file or on the computer system
        which refers in any
        <br />
        way to suspicious activity reporting, money laundering, etc., to avoid
        the risk of tipping off. It is a<br />
        criminal offense to inform a customer that a SAR has been submitted, or
        to inform them of an
        <br />
        investigation into their affairs.
        <br />
        All records of SARs will be kept in the central reporting file, which is
        kept by the MLRO.
        <br />
        15.7.3 How to Identify Suspicious Activity
        <br />
        Transactions may give reasonable grounds to suspect that they are
        related to money laundering
        <br />
        or terrorist activity financing regardless of the sum of money involved.
        There is no monetary
        <br />
        threshold for making a SAR. Suspicious transactions may involve several
        factors that on their
        <br />
        own seem insignificant, but together raise suspicion that the
        transaction is related to the
        <br />
        commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist
        activity financing
        <br />
        offence, or both. As a general guide, a transaction may be connected to
        money laundering or
        <br />
        terrorist activity financing when we think that it (or a group of
        transactions) raises questions or
        <br />
        gives rise to discomfort, apprehension or mistrust.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz will examine, as far as reasonably possible, the background
        and purpose of all
        <br />
        complex, unusual large transactions, and all unusual patterns of
        transactions, which have no
        <br />
        apparent economic or lawful purpose.
        <br />
        The context in which the transaction occurs or is attempted is a
        significant factor in assessing
        <br />
        suspicion and this will vary from one customer to another.
        <br />
        Transactions will be evaluated in terms of what seems appropriate and is
        within normal
        <br />
        practices in business and based on our knowledge of the customer. The
        fact that transactions
        <br />
        do not appear to be in keeping with normal industry practices may be a
        relevant factor.
        <br />
        Reasonable evaluation of relevant factors, including the knowledge of
        the customer's business,
        <br />
        financial history, background and behavior is the basis of assessing
        suspicion. Behavior is
        <br />
        suspicious, not people. We have listed below some indicators to help
        with this assessment.
        <br />
        15.7.4 Indicators of Suspicious Transactions
        <br />
        Certain products, services, activities or channels may pose a higher
        risk of misuse for money
        <br />
        laundering. Listed below are several anti-money laundering risk
        indicators or &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; that
        <br />
        might be grounds for suspicion. The list is not exhaustive and not
        conclusive but will be used as
        <br />
        a guide for inquiry and follow-up, alongside other material.
        <br />
        A single indicator does not necessarily indicate reasonable grounds to
        suspect money
        <br />
        laundering or terrorist financing activity. However, if several
        indicators are present during one or
        <br />
        a series of transactions, then we will take a closer look at other
        factors before deciding whether
        <br />
        the transaction must be reported.
        <br />
        In the case of a transaction aborted in the belief that the property is
        owned or controlled by or on
        <br />
        behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist group, then there must be a
        terrorist property report. If there are
        <br />
        reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to an
        attempted commission of a<br />
        terrorist activity financing or money laundering offence, then a
        suspicious transaction report
        <br />
        about the attempted transaction is also required.
        <br />
        Becoming aware of certain indicators could trigger reasonable grounds to
        suspect that one or
        <br />
        more transactions from the past (that had not previously seemed
        suspicious) were related to
        <br />
        money laundering or terrorist financing.
        <br />
        15.7.4.1 Application and Identification
        <br />
        Information mismatch from application
        <br />
        Application information/address/customer differs from initial
        registration
        <br />
        Inability to provide government issued identification details
        <br />
        Change of address to high-fraud area or to problematic jurisdiction,
        shortly after the application
        <br />
        Lack of reliable third party and/or governmental verification of
        individual
        <br />
        The address indicated (or corroborated) is identified as mail drop or
        other high-risk address, as
        <br />
        opposed to a physical street address
        <br />
        Transaction volume, deposits, and cash-outs are inconsistent
        <br />
        15.7.4.2 Account Settlement
        <br />
        Large, cross-border wire transfer payments
        <br />
        Settlements/partial settlements from unrelated third parties
        <br />
        Excessive/ongoing large credit refunds
        <br />
        15.7.4.3 Transaction and Customer Monitoring
        <br />
        Stakes wagered by a customer become unusually high or out of the
        ordinary and the customer
        <br />
        is believed to be spending beyond his or her known means. This requires
        some knowledge of
        <br />
        the customer but, nevertheless, there may be circumstances that appear
        unusual and raise the
        <br />
        suspicion that he is using money obtained unlawfully.
        <br />
        It may be that the customer lives in low cost accommodation with no
        known source of income
        <br />
        but nonetheless is spending money well above his or her apparent means.
        <br />
        There is no set amount which dictates when a SAR should be made and much
        will depend on
        <br />
        what is known, or suspected, about the customer.
        <br />
        A customer exhibits unusual gambling patterns with an almost guaranteed
        return or very little
        <br />
        financial risk.
        <br />
        It is accepted that some customers prefer to gamble in this way but, in
        some instances, the
        <br />
        actions may raise suspicion because they are different from the
        customer&rsquo;s normal gambling
        <br />
        practices.
        <br />
        Money is deposited by a customer or held over a period and withdrawn by
        the customer without
        <br />
        being used for gambling.
        <br />
        For instance, suspicions should be raised by any large amounts deposited
        in gaming machines
        <br />
        or gambling accounts that are then cashed or withdrawn after very little
        game play or gambling.
        <br />
        A customer regularly gambles large amounts of money and appears to find
        a level of losses
        <br />
        acceptable.
        <br />
        In this instance, the customer may be spending the proceeds of crime and
        sees the losses as
        <br />
        an acceptable consequence of the process of laundering those proceeds.
        <br />
        A customer's spend increases over a period of time, thereby masking high
        spend and potential
        <br />
        money laundering.
        <br />
        A customer spends little, but often, and his annual aggregate spend is
        high and out of kilter with
        <br />
        his expected spend.
        <br />
        A customer displays gambling patterns where spend is high but the risk
        is low, for example
        <br />
        gambling on red and black in roulette. The customer could be laundering
        money in a way that
        <br />
        guarantees minimal loss.
        <br />
        Instances of high spend by customers that lead to significant commercial
        risk for the operator
        <br />
        may also indicate suspicious activity.
        <br />
        Indicators to help establish suspicion that a transaction may be related
        to a terrorist activity
        <br />
        financing offence mostly resemble those relating to money laundering,
        although there are some
        <br />
        differences. For example, amounts relating to terrorist financing
        generally may be smaller.
        <br />
        15.7.4. Financial Sanctions
        <br />
        It is the policy of bettingbaaz to verify the identity of all customers,
        and to check that they are not
        <br />
        the subject of sanctions or other statutory measures prohibiting the
        Company from providing its
        <br />
        services. The member of staff conducting verification of identity will
        complete the process by
        <br />
        checking that the customer is not the subject of sanctions or other
        statutory measures, using the
        <br />
        screening methods set out by the MLRO. These include the direct
        questions to the prospective
        <br />
        customer, screening of all new customers against sanctions and other
        databases (via direct
        <br />
        reference to an official list or using a commercially available
        product), and ongoing screening of
        <br />
        all customer names (via ongoing subscription to commercially available
        products and automatic
        <br />
        uploads).
        <br />
        15.7.5. Adverse Media
        <br />
        Along with Sanctions and PEP databases, third-party providers offer a
        service that screens
        <br />
        individuals for adverse media. bettingbaaz uses such a service to
        identify if a customer has
        <br />
        been identified by the media as having links to financial crime,
        terrorist financing and/or other
        <br />
        criminal activity. These individuals, once confirmed to be one and the
        same in both media and
        <br />
        among the bettingbaaz customers, would only be allowed to continue using
        bettingbaaz
        <br />
        services after a close review by the MLRO and/or senior management.
        <br />
        15.8. Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing
        <br />
        As an extension to the AML/CFT efforts, bettingbaaz also employs
        Anti-Bribery and
        <br />
        Whistleblowing Policies and Procedures. These are standalone documents
        that are available to
        <br />
        all employees and are part of their onboarding package.
        <br />
        15.9. Employee Background Checks
        <br />
        bettingbaaz is committed to establish and maintain procedures which
        enable it to be satisfied as
        <br />
        to the integrity of all new staff members and by extension their
        likelihood to follow the
        <br />
        bettingbaaz policies and procedures. To meet this requirement, the Human

        17. Responsible Gaming Policy
        <br />
        bettingbaaz is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its
        customers as well as
        <br />
        promoting the awareness of problem gambling and improving prevention,
        intervention and
        <br />
        treatment.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz&rsquo;s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment
        to minimizing the negative
        <br />
        effects of problem gambling and to promoting responsible gambling
        practices.
        <br />
        bettingbaaz supports the generation of online gamblers offering them a
        wide range of games
        <br />
        and entertainment. We also take responsibility for our product line-up.
        <br />
        The aim of bettingbaaz is to provide the world&rsquo;s safest and most
        innovative gaming platform for
        <br />
        adults. The offered clear and safe products allow each user to play
        within his financial means
        <br />
        and to receive the highest quality service. Integrity, fairness and
        reliability are the guiding
        <br />
        principles of bettingbaaz&rsquo;s work. It is therefore clear that
        bettingbaaz should do its best to avoid
        <br />
        and reduce the problems, which can arise from participation in gambling,
        particularly in cases of
        <br />
        immoderate playing. At the same time it is important to respect the
        rights of those who take part
        <br />
        in games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of entertainment.
        <br />
        Responsible Gaming at bettingbaaz is based on three fundamental
        principles: Security of the
        <br />
        player, Security of the game and Protection against gaming addiction.
        Together with research
        <br />
        institutes, associations and therapy institutions, we work on creation
        of a responsible, secure
        <br />
        and reliable framework for online gaming.
        <br />
        Player security
        <br />
        We take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of
        the players is based on
        <br />
        forbidding the attendance of the minors from participation in games and
        the protection of
        <br />
        privacy, which involves responsible processing of personal data and
        payments. Fairness and
        <br />
        the random nature of the products offered are monitored closely by
        independent organizations.
        <br />
        Marketing communication is also geared towards player protection: we
        promise only what
        <br />
        players can receive in our transparent line.
        <br />
        Protection against gaming addiction: research &ndash; prevention &ndash;
        intervention
        <br />
        The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming
        offers play in
        <br />
        moderation for entertainment. Certain habits and behavior patterns (such
        as shopping, playing
        <br />
        sports, eating or consumption of alcohol) which are considered to be
        normal and not causing
        <br />
        any concern can develop into addiction for some people and cause
        problems. In the same way,
        <br />
        bets on sports and gambling can lead to problems for a small group of
        customers.
        <br />
        Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation
        in the gaming line-up.
        <br />
        Subsequently the customers are provided with contacts of organizations
        where they can receive
        <br />
        professional advice and support.
        <br />
        Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention
        <br />
        The basic principle promoted by bettingbaaz is that the final decision
        and responsibility on
        <br />
        whether to play or not, and how much money can be spent on the game
        should be assumed by
        <br />
        the customer himself.
        <br />
        Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective form
        of protection from
        <br />
        addiction. bettingbaaz sees its responsibility in assisting the
        customers by providing transparent
        <br />
        products, full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.
        <br />
        Protection of minors
        <br />
        bettingbaaz does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to
        participate in games and
        <br />
        make bets. That&rsquo;s why the confirmation of having reached the age
        of majority and the
        <br />
        confirmation of date of birth are mandatory requirements during
        registration. bettingbaaz
        <br />
        considers the issue of minors taking part in games and betting very
        seriously. In order to offer
        <br />
        the best possible protection of minors, we also rely on the support of
        parents and caregivers.
        <br />
        Please keep your data for account access in a safe place (user ID and
        password).
        <br />
        Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This
        software will allow you to
        <br />
        restrict the access to Internet resources inappropriate for children and
        teenagers.
        <br />
        Responsibility towards problems
        <br />
        bettingbaaz offers a variety of games and bets, which are forms of
        entertainment for the majority
        <br />
        of customers. At the same time the company takes responsibility for its
        customers by providing
        <br />
        support and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining
        environment taking into account
        <br />
        the associated risks.
        <br />
        The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their
        own limits or those who
        <br />
        suffer from gambling addiction are not able to enjoy our product line-up
        responsibly and
        <br />
        perceive it as a form of entertainment. bettingbaaz takes responsibility
        for such users by
        <br />
        blocking their access to its products for their own protection.
        <br />
        Get informed with the main issues
        <br />
        Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within
        their financial capacity is
        <br />
        fully acceptable. However, for a small percentage of people gambling is
        not a form of
        <br />
        entertainment, it is a challenge that must be considered seriously.
        <br />
        What is the problematic game behavior?
        <br />
        A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior, which
        interferes with the mode
        <br />
        of life, work, financial position or health of a person or his family.
        Long participation in games is
        <br />
        counter indicative to such a person as it can lead to negative
        consequences.
        <br />
        In 1980 the pathological game dependence was officially recognized and
        enlisted in the list of
        <br />
        psychological diseases of the international classification system DSM-IV
        and ICD-10. It is
        <br />
        defined as long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for
        game, despite existing
        <br />
        negative personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of
        family relations and
        <br />
        delay of professional growth.
        <br />
        In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as dependence?
        <br />
        It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can
        be qualified only by
        <br />
        experts. The material presented on this web-page will help you to
        estimate and define your own
        <br />
        game behavior.
        <br />
        The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any
        substance is that it is very
        <br />
        difficult to define the line between pleasure and addiction.
        Nevertheless, there are some
        <br />
        diagnostic signals that may point out the existing problems. In the
        presence of at least five of the
        <br />
        following symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:
        <br />
        1. The player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are only
        about the game.
        <br />
        2. Bet sum increases in course of time.
        <br />
        3. Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to
        be unsuccessful.
        <br />
        4. When limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences
        irritation and
        <br />
        disappointment.
        <br />
        5. The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.
        <br />
        6. The player tries to win back the lost amount,
        <br />
        7. Lies about his playing behavior,
        <br />
        8. Commits illegal acts,
        <br />
        9. Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,
        <br />
        10. Borrows to participate in the games.
        <br />

        22. Self-exclusion
        <br />
        If you feel you are at risk of developing a gambling problem or believe
        you currently have a<br />

        account for betting, although
        <br />
        you will still be able to login and withdraw any remaining balance. It
        will not be possible to
        <br />
        re-open your account for any reason, and bettingbaaz will do all it can
        to detect and close any
        <br />
        new accounts you may open.
