        come from a restricted
        <br />
        territory.
        <br />
        1. Use and interpretation
        <br />
        The Exchange Rules and Regulations (&quot;Exchange Rules&quot;) are part
        of terms and conditions.
        <br />
        The Exchange Rules apply to all bets placed on Exchange markets. The
        Exchange Rules also
        <br />
        apply to Exchange &rsquo;Multiples&rsquo; product (see the Multiples
        section below for further details). The
        <br />
        Exchange Rules consist of the following:
        <br />
        This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);
        <br />
        The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below);
        <br />
        The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below &ndash; these apply
        to certain sports and to
        <br />
        financial markets); and
        <br />
        The MARKET INFORMATION (located on every market either under the tab
        entitled &quot;Rules&quot; or
        <br />
        under the &lsquo;Rules&rsquo;).
        <br />
        The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the
        Market Information or the
        <br />
        Specific Sports Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the
        Specific Sports Rules and the
        <br />
        General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail. If there is any
        inconsistency between the
        <br />
        Market Information and either the General Rules or the Specific Sports
        Rules, the Market
        <br />
        Information shall prevail, except where the General Rules or Specific
        Sports Rules use the
        <br />
        phrase 'regardless of what it says in the Market Information' or similar
        wording.
        <br />
        For any category or market not referred to in the Specific Sports Rules
        (e.g. &rsquo;Special Bets&rsquo; or
        <br />
        beach volleyball), the General Rules and Market Information will apply.
        <br />
        2. Market information
        <br />
        The Market Information is provided for information purposes as an
        at-a-glance guide on how to
        <br />
        manage the market. The Market Information may also contain rules on
        market settlement,
        <br />
        however it must always be read in conjunction with the General Rules and
        the relevant Specific
        <br />
        Sports Rules and a link to this Rules and Regulations page will usually
        be provided in the
        <br />
        Market Information for each market.
        <br />
        Whilst the Market Information may give a guide to how markets will be
        managed, regardless of
        <br />
        what it says in the Market Information, it reserves the right to suspend
        any market at any time at
        <br />
        its sole discretion, including in order to carry out necessary
        administration and/or to take any
        <br />
        necessary action to protect the customers.
        <br />
        It shall not amend the Market Information after a market has been loaded
        except to correct
        <br />
        obvious errors and/or to add wording to clarify the Market Information
        where appropriate.
        <br />
        3. Customer responsibility
        <br />
        The customers should make themselves aware of all the Exchange Rules
        affecting any market
        <br />
        on which they wish to place a bet. Customers should not simply rely on
        the Market Information
        <br />
        as the Market Information is unlikely to contain all of the applicable
        rules relating to a market.
        <br />
        By their nature &lsquo;Special Bets&rsquo; markets are unpredictable so
        should be treated with particular
        <br />
        caution. Customers are responsible for managing their own positions at
        all times in such
        <br />
        markets. Customers should pay particular attention to the Market
        Information on &lsquo;Special Bets&rsquo;
        <br />
        markets to ensure they understand the basis on which the market will be
        administered and
        <br />
        settled.
        <br />
        4. Customer betting disputes &amp; IBAS
        <br />
        Any customer who has any concerns or questions regarding the Exchange
        Rules or regarding
        <br />
        the settlement of any market should contact.
        <br />
        If a customer is not satisfied with how a bet or a market has been
        settled then the customer
        <br />
        should provide details of their grievance.
        <br />
        Part B - General rules
        <br />
        1. Managing markets In-Play
        <br />
        a) General
        <br />
        For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market
        is not scheduled to be
        <br />
        turned in-play but fails to suspend the market at the relevant time,
        then:
        <br />
        if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that
        scheduled off time will be void;
        <br />
        and
        <br />
        if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its
        reasonable endeavours to
        <br />
        ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of
        the 'off' determined will be void.
        <br />
        For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be
        turned in-play but fails
        <br />
        to suspend the market at the relevant time, then all bets matched after
        the official 'off' time will
        <br />
        be void.
        <br />
        It aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets at
        the start of and at the
        <br />
        end of the event. However, regardless of what it says in the Market
        Information, it does not
        <br />
        guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
        <br />
        It will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange market that
        has been turned
        <br />
        in-play.
        <br />
        Customers are responsible for managing their in-play bets at all times.
        <br />
        For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that
        transmissions described as
        <br />
        &quot;live&quot; by some broadcasters may be delayed or pre-recorded.
        The extent of any delay may vary
        <br />
        depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or
        data.
        <br />
        b) All markets other than soccer markets and Australian markets - not
        suspending at the time of
        <br />
        the 'off'
        <br />
        In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play, aims to
        use its reasonable
        <br />
        endeavours to turn such markets in-play at the time of the 'off'. The
        time of the 'off' for such
        <br />
        markets should be set out in the Market Information. However, regardless
        of what it says in the
        <br />
        Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will be
        suspended and turned
        <br />
        in-play at the time of the 'off'.
        <br />
        If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not suspend the
        market and cancel
        <br />
        unmatched bets at the time of the 'off' and the market is not turned
        in-play with unmatched bets
        <br />
        cancelled at any time during the event, all bets matched after the
        scheduled time of the 'off' will
        <br />
        be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be
        void from the official
        <br />
        rather than the scheduled 'off' time).
        <br />
        If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its
        reasonable endeavours to
        <br />
        ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of
        the 'off' determined will be void.
        <br />
        If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not suspend the
        market at the time of the
        <br />
        'off' (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market
        is intentionally turned
        <br />
        in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the
        time of the 'off' will stand
        <br />
        c) Soccer markets (with the exception of Australian soccer markets) -
        not suspending at kick-off
        <br />
        or on the occurrence of a Material Event
        <br />
        Not suspending at kick-off
        <br />
        In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play,
        aims to use its reasonable
        <br />
        endeavours to turn such markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such
        markets on the
        <br />
        occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of &quot;Material
        Event&quot; below).
        <br />
        The relevant scheduled kick-off time should be set out in the Market
        Information. However,
        <br />
        regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does not
        guarantee that such markets will
        <br />
        be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.
        <br />
        If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the market
        at kick-off and the
        <br />
        market is not turned in-play at any time during the match, all bets
        matched after the scheduled
        <br />
        time of the kick-off will be void.
        <br />
        If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the market
        at kick-off (so
        <br />
        unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is turned
        in-play at a later time
        <br />
        during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the
        kick-off and before the first
        <br />
        &quot;Material Event&quot; will stand. However, if there has been one or
        more &quot;Material Events&quot;, any bets
        <br />
        matched between the first &quot;Material Event&quot; and the market
        being turned in-play will be void.
        <br />
        Not suspending on the occurrence of a Material Event
        <br />
        If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a Material
        Event, it reserves the
        <br />
        right to void bets unfairly matched after the Material Event has
        occurred. Voiding of these bets
        <br />
        may take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is
        completed.
        <br />
        Definition of &ldquo;Material Event&rdquo;
        <br />
        For the purpose of these Exchange Rules, a &quot;Material Event&quot;
        shall mean a goal being scored, a<br />
        penalty being awarded or a player being sent off.
        <br />
        d) In-play Australian markets
        <br />
        Notwithstanding the other in-play rules described above, in relation
        specifically to any Australian
        <br />
        market that is scheduled to be turned in-play, if it fails to suspend
        the market at the 'off' then all
        <br />
        bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off' and before the market
        is turned in-play will be
        <br />
        void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void
        from the official rather
        <br />
        than the scheduled &lsquo;off&rsquo; time). If the event does not have a
        scheduled 'off' time, it will use its
        <br />
        reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all
        bets after the time of the
        <br />
        'off' as determined will be void.
        <br />
        2. Results and market settlement
        <br />
        a) General
        <br />
        Markets will be settled as set out in the Market Information and/or the
        Specific Sports Rules.
        <br />
        Where the Market Information or Specific Sports Rules do not specify how
        and on what basis a<br />
        market will be settled, markets will be settled on the official result
        of the relevant governing body
        <br />
        regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result
        (except if an
        <br />
        amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial settlement of the
        relevant market in order
        <br />
        to correct an error in reporting the result).
        <br />
        If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the
        result will be determined by
        <br />
        using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new
        information comes into
        <br />
        the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting
        reasonably) determine
        <br />
        either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in
        light of this new information; or
        <br />
        (ii) whether or not to wait for further information before deciding
        whether to reinstate or resettle
        <br />
        the market. Except it has announced that it is waiting for further
        information, any information that
        <br />
        comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been
        settled shall not be
        <br />
        considered (regardless of whether or not such information may have led
        to a different result).
        <br />
        In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential result, it
        reserves the right to
        <br />
        suspend settlement of any market for an unlimited period until the
        uncertainty can be resolved
        <br />
        to the reasonable satisfaction. It reserves the right to void any market
        if the uncertainty
        <br />
        regarding settlement cannot be resolved to reasonable satisfaction.
        <br />
        b) Resettlements
        <br />
        Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in
        question. It may settle (or
        <br />
        part-settle) some markets before the official result is declared (or may
        increase a customer's
        <br />
        'available to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of that
        customer on a given market)
        <br />
        purely as a customer service benefit. However, it reserves the right to
        amend the settlement of
        <br />
        the market if: (i) the official result is different to the result on
        which initially settled the market (for
        <br />
        example, a horseracing result being changed by the relevant governing
        body shortly after a<br />
        race, but before the result is official); or (ii) if the whole market is
        eventually voided (e.g. for an
        <br />
        abandoned event).
        <br />
        It reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market
        is settled in error (for
        <br />
        example, a human or technical error).
        <br />
        If resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a
        customer's balance to
        <br />
        reflect changes in market settlement.
        <br />
        c) Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications
        <br />
        Subject always right to void bets under its terms and conditions or for
        any exception under the
        <br />
        Exchange Rules, if a market contains a statement that says, &quot;All
        bets stand, run or not&quot; (or
        <br />
        something similar) in the Market Information, then all bets on a team or
        competitor will stand
        <br />
        regardless of whether or not the team or competitor starts the event or
        takes any part in the
        <br />
        event.
        <br />
        Where the Market Information does not stipulate that all bets will stand
        regardless of
        <br />
        participation, customers should refer to the relevant Specific Sports
        Rules.
        <br />
        If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits after
        starting an event they will be
        <br />
        deemed a loser providing at least one other team or competitor completes
        the event. If no team
        <br />
        or competitor completes an event (having started) then all bets will be
        void except for bets on
        <br />
        any markets which have been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        d) Winner with [named selection]' markets
        <br />
        It may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the
        participation of a particular
        <br />
        competitor. If the competitor named either in a 'Winner with &#8230;'
        market title or in the Market
        <br />
        Information does not participate in the tournament or event then all
        bets on the market will be
        <br />
        void. For example, if there was a &quot;Winner with Federer&quot; tennis
        market, all bets on the market
        <br />
        would be void if Federer did not participate in the tournament. However,
        if any other competitor
        <br />
        did not participate, then bets would stand.
        <br />
        A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they have
        taken part to the extent
        <br />
        necessary to record an official result or classification (including any
        disqualification but excluding
        <br />
        any &quot;did not start&quot; or equivalent classification).
        <br />
        3. Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements
        <br />
        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
        Sports Rules and/or the
        <br />
        Market Information. However, where a market has no rules in the Specific
        Sports Rules or the
        <br />
        Market Information in relation to an abandonment, cancellation and/or
        postponement the
        <br />
        following shall apply.
        <br />
        In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race or
        similar: If the event is not
        <br />
        completed within three days after the scheduled completion date, then
        all bets on markets for
        <br />
        this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that have been
        unconditionally
        <br />
        determined.
        <br />
        In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event is
        not completed within three
        <br />
        days after the scheduled completion date, then any markets relating to
        the event will be settled
        <br />
        in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant governing body,
        providing such a decision is
        <br />
        given within 90 days after the scheduled completion date. If no official
        ruling is announced in this
        <br />
        90-day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be
        void, except for bets on any
        <br />
        markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be
        voided but has been
        <br />
        part-settled as a courtesy to customers, then such part-settled bets
        will be reversed and all bets
        <br />
        on the market will be void.
        <br />
        It will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a match
        (or similar) or a<br />
        tournament (or similar). However, by way of example, the following shall
        apply: (i) Europa
        <br />
        League outright = tournament; (ii) Champions&rsquo; League Group
        outright = tournament; (iii) Top
        <br />
        Premiership goal scorer = tournament; (iv) 72-hole Golf Match bet =
        match; (v) Ryder Cup
        <br />
        outright = tournament; (vi) Golf tournament outright = tournament; (vii)
        Tennis Tournament
        <br />
        outright = tournament;(viii) 5-day Cricket Test Match = match; (ix)
        Ashes Series outright winner
        <br />
        = tournament; (x) Motor Race (e.g. Grand Prix) = match.
        <br />
        4. Change of venue
        <br />
        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
        Sports Rules and/or the
        <br />
        Market Information. However, if change of venue is not dealt with in the
        Specific Sports Rules
        <br />
        and/or the Market Information then the following shall apply:
        <br />
        For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market
        is loaded, all bets will be
        <br />
        void only if the new venue is a home ground of the original away team
        <br />
        For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled
        venue is changed after
        <br />
        the market is loaded, all bets will stand.
        <br />
        If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a hockey
        match switching from grass
        <br />
        to Astor-turf) after the market has been loaded, all bets will stand.
        <br />
        5. Periods of time
        <br />
        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
        Sports Rules and/or the
        <br />
        Market Information. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports
        Rules or the Market
        <br />
        Information then the following shall apply.
        <br />
        If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the market has
        been loaded but before
        <br />
        the start of the event, then all bets will be void.
        <br />
        Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the
        event (e.g. time of first goal).
        <br />
        If an event happens in stoppage or injury time after any regular time
        period then it will be
        <br />
        deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular time period. For
        example, if a goal is scored
        <br />
        in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have
        occurred on 45 minutes.
        <br />
        All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period including
        stoppage time. Any extra-time
        <br />
        and/or penalty shoot-out is not included.
        <br />
        References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular number of
        'days' shall mean the
        <br />
        end of the day local time after the expiry of the specified number of
        days. For example, if a<br />
        rugby match is scheduled for the 1st of December, then the rule that
        allows the match to be
        <br />
        completed within three days after the scheduled completion date (see
        Paragraph 3 above)
        <br />
        would mean that the deadline for completion of that match would be
        23.59:59 on the 4th of
        <br />
        December.
        <br />
        6. Match bets
        <br />
        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
        Sports Rules and/or the
        <br />
        Market Information. For example, for match bets on Golf markets the
        rules are set out in the
        <br />
        Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports
        Rules or the Market
        <br />
        Information then the following shall apply.
        <br />
        'Match Bets' for one-off events are determined by the competitor or team
        with the best score,
        <br />
        time or finishing position in the event. If none of the competitors or
        teams involved in the match
        <br />
        bet complete the event or register a score, time or finishing position
        then bets are void unless
        <br />
        specified otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
        Information. Any competitor
        <br />
        or team not completing an event or registering a score, time or
        finishing position having taken
        <br />
        part in the match bet event will be settled as a loser providing at
        least one other team or
        <br />
        competitor completes that event or registers a score, time or finishing
        position.
        <br />
        'Match Bets' for progress in a competition or event with multiple heats
        or rounds are determined
        <br />
        by the competitor or team which qualifies to the furthest round (whether
        it takes part in the
        <br />
        further round or not) or with the best score, time or finishing position
        in the final or same heat of
        <br />
        that competition or event. If the relevant competitors or teams fail to
        qualify in the same round of
        <br />
        the competition but in different heats then dead-heat rules will apply,
        irrespective of the finishing
        <br />
        positions in their respective heats. Markets will be part-settled after
        the end of each round and
        <br />
        any subsequent disqualifications, penalties or amendments to results or
        qualifications will not
        <br />
        have any effect on the market. Where one or more of the competitors or
        teams are disqualified,
        <br />
        for the purposes of settlement, the disqualified competitor or team will
        be deemed to have
        <br />
        progressed further in the competition or event than all those eliminated
        from the competition or
        <br />
        event prior to the disqualification, and will be deemed to have finished
        last (or joint last if there is
        <br />
        more than one disqualification) of those still competing in the
        competition or event.
        <br />
        Disqualification will be considered to have taken place at the time of
        the competitor's or team's
        <br />
        removal from the competition or event by the relevant governing body,
        rather than at the time of
        <br />
        the event which caused disqualification.
        <br />
        If one of the competitors or teams does not take any part in the event,
        then all relevant match
        <br />
        bets will be void.
        <br />
        If an event or tournament is abandoned or reduced in duration such that
        any competitor or team
        <br />
        fails to complete the match bet, event or tournament for any reason
        other than withdrawal or
        <br />
        disqualification then all bets will be void except for those on markets
        which have been
        <br />
        unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        7. &quot;To qualify&quot; markets
        <br />
        Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific
        Sports Rules and/or the
        <br />
        Market Information. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports
        Rules or the Market
        <br />
        Information then the following shall apply.
        <br />
        Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. &quot;to reach the final&quot; markets)
        will be determined by the competitor or
        <br />
        team that qualifies under the terms set out in Market Information,
        whether or not they take part
        <br />
        in the next round or event for which they have qualified. Markets will
        be settled after the
        <br />
        qualifying stage and any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the
        result will not count.
        <br />
        8. Dead heats
        <br />
        Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market
        Information the Dead
        <br />
        Heat Rule applies to bets on a market where there are more winners than
        expected (as set out
        <br />
        in the Market Information).
        <br />
        For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake money is
        first reduced in
        <br />
        proportion by multiplying it by the sum of the number of winners
        expected (as set out in the
        <br />
        Market Information), divided by the number of actual winners (i.e. stake
        multiplied by (number of
        <br />
        winners expected/number of actual winners)). The winnings are then paid
        to the successful
        <br />
        backers on this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded
        price) and the remaining
        <br />
        stake money is paid to the appropriate layers.
        <br />
        For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between three
        horses. 'Client A' has
        <br />
        backed one of the winners for a stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0
        and 'Client B' has taken
        <br />
        the other side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300)
        is multiplied by 1/3 (i.e. the
        <br />
        number of expected winners (1) divided by the number of actual winners
        (3)) to calculate the
        <br />
        reduced stake (100) and the remainder given to the layer (200). The
        backer then receives the
        <br />
        traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 =
        400). In this example,
        <br />
        Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus the original 300
        stake), and Client B's net
        <br />
        losses are 100. Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount
        paid to the traded price
        <br />
        divided by the number of dead-heaters. In the above example, this would
        be 300 at the traded
        <br />
        price of 4.0 (1200) divided by 3; making 400 payouts and 100 net
        winnings.
        <br />
        By way of another example, assume there is an outright winner in a golf
        tournament but 7<br />
        players tie for 2nd place. In the &quot;top 5 finish&quot; market, after
        settling on the outright winner in the
        <br />
        top 5 market there would be 4 others designated winner&rsquo;s places
        available. 'Client A' has
        <br />
        backed one of the winners for 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client
        B' has taken the other
        <br />
        side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is
        multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the number of
        <br />
        expected winners (4) divided by the number of actual winners (7)) to
        calculate the reduced
        <br />
        stake (171.43) and the remainder given to the layer (128.57). The backer
        then receives the
        <br />
        traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 171.43 =
        685.72). In this
        <br />
        example, Client A's net winnings are 385.72 (685.72 payout minus the
        original 300 stake), and
        <br />
        Client B's net losses are 385.72.
        <br />
        In relation to customers whose betting counterparty, for the purposes of
        this section of the
        <br />
        Exchange Rules dealing with dead heats, the terms 'Client A', 'Client B'
        and 'appropriate layers'
        <br />
        should, where relevant, be read
        <br />
        9. Exchange Multiples
        <br />
        The Exchange Rules only apply to Exchange Multiples.
        <br />
        Customers placing a multiple bet will be betting with each other will
        act as the counterparty to
        <br />
        the bet.
        <br />
        A multiple bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is defined as one or
        more chosen selections in
        <br />
        any individual event market.
        <br />
        It reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept certain
        multiple bets or to scale back
        <br />
        stakes in certain circumstances.
        <br />
        All multiple bets placed are subject to the Exchange Rules that apply to
        each individual sport
        <br />
        that relates to any leg of any multiple bet.
        <br />
        The maximum payout limit for Exchange Multiples is &pound;1,000,000.
        <br />
        Customers can place an Exchange Multiple bet using back, or where
        available lay or a mixture
        <br />
        of back and lay selections. However, customers cannot have a combination
        of back and lay
        <br />
        selections in any one leg.
        <br />
        If customers choose more than one selection in one leg the odds for this
        leg will be &quot;dutched&quot;
        <br />
        which means they will be combined to reflect the chances of any of the
        selections within the leg
        <br />
        winning (if backed) or all of the selections losing (if laid). If
        customers wish to place a<br />
        cross-multiple bet (i.e. more than one selection in any event market but
        not using &quot;dutched&quot;
        <br />
        prices) they will need to enter each Exchange Multiple bet separately.
        <br />
        Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at Starting Price
        (&quot;BSP&quot;), the odds available via the
        <br />
        Exchange Multiples product will be broadly based on the relevant singles
        markets on the
        <br />
        Exchange and any such winning multiple bet will be subject to commission
        as set out in the
        <br />
        Charges' section of the website.
        <br />
        Any winnings from Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP will not be
        subject to commission, but
        <br />
        the odds returned on each leg in such a multiple will be subject to a 5%
        deduction from the BSP.
        <br />
        A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet for selections in the
        multiple to win and a bet on
        <br />
        the same selections to place. For example, a &pound;2 each way double
        represents a &pound;2 bet on both
        <br />
        selections to win and a &pound;2 bet on both selections to be placed,
        with a total stake for the bet of
        <br />
        &pound;4. The number of places for each event in each way multiples bet
        are shown on the multiples
        <br />
        win Market Information and do not change. Should the number of runners
        be equal to or less
        <br />
        than the number of places available, the relevant place leg of any
        multiples bet will be void
        <br />
        The minimum total stake for any Exchange Multiple bet is &pound;2. For
        example, a 20p &quot;Yankee&quot; (11
        <br />
        bet combinations) representing a total stake of &pound;2.20 is
        permitted. However, a 1p &quot;Heinz&quot; (57
        <br />
        bet combinations) representing a total stake of &pound;0.57 or a
        &pound;1 double (1 bet combination)
        <br />
        representing a total stake of &pound;1 will not be permitted. For
        customers betting in currencies other
        <br />
        than English Sterling, the minimum total stake which applies to an
        Exchange Multiple bet will not
        <br />
        necessarily be the equivalent of &pound;2, though it will be calculated
        as described in the example
        <br />
        above.
        <br />
        If, in its sole discretion, will determine the markets that are
        available for Exchange Multiples.
        <br />
        Events available for Exchange Multiples will be those listed within any
        individual Exchange
        <br />
        Multiple group (e.g. UK football fixtures for any given day). Not all
        markets will be available via
        <br />
        the Exchange Multiples product.
        <br />
        With the exception of the rule directly below, if any selection in any
        leg is a non-runner or
        <br />
        otherwise void under the Exchange Rules (e.g. an abandoned match) then
        all bets on that
        <br />
        individual leg will be void and the Exchange Multiple bet shall be
        adjusted accordingly. For
        <br />
        example, a treble including one void leg will become a double. This
        means that if customers
        <br />
        have more than one selection in any leg (i.e. in cases of 'ditching')
        and one of those selections is
        <br />
        a non-runner, the whole leg will be void. In the event that voided legs
        mean that an individual
        <br />
        bet within a multiple becomes a single bet, then this single bet will
        stand.
        <br />
        Notwithstanding the rule directly above, for Exchange Multiples bets
        struck at BSP, if customers
        <br />
        have more than one selection in any leg and one of those selections is a
        non-runner the leg will
        <br />
        stand. For example, if customers back both Desert Orchid and Red Rum in
        an individual horse
        <br />
        race and Red Rum is a non-runner, the leg will become a back of just
        Desert Orchid.
        <br />
        It reserves the right not to accept certain combinations of Exchange
        Multiples, such as those
        <br />
        including related contingencies (i.e. where the outcome of one event is
        likely to affect the odds
        <br />
        on the outcome of another event). This may happen automatically at the
        bet placement stage.
        <br />
        Alternatively, if such bet is taken in error, it may void the individual
        bet combinations which
        <br />
        include two or more of the related contingency selections.
        <br />
        It may offer special markets on related events from time to time,
        including within its normal
        <br />
        markets (i.e. outside of the Exchange Multiples product), for example a
        market on Chelsea to
        <br />
        win the English domestic double (i.e. Premiership and FA Cup).
        <br />
        When placing any Exchange Multiple bet, the prices shown only give an
        indicative guide as to
        <br />
        the price available for each leg and the overall multiple. Other than
        Exchange Multiples bets
        <br />
        struck at BSP, the price of each leg and the overall multiple price that
        customers get will be fixed
        <br />
        when the multiple bet is actually placed and customers will then be able
        to see these prices. For
        <br />
        more details on this customer should refer to the 'help' files.
        <br />
        Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on &lsquo;day of the
        race&rsquo; markets (and not ante-post
        <br />
        markets). Horseracing ante-post rules do not therefore apply in relation
        to horseracing
        <br />
        Exchange Multiples.
        <br />
        10. Rules for Starting Price
        <br />
        Starting Price ('SP') is available on the Exchange. Exchange SP bets
        (&lsquo;SP bets&rsquo;) are therefore a<br />
        type of Exchange bet. The SP is calculated as, by balancing all SP bets
        and other Exchange
        <br />
        bets when the market is suspended at the 'off' of the relevant event.
        The details of this
        <br />
        calculation are provided directly below.
        <br />
        Please note that for all customers, an SP bet cannot be cancelled once
        it has been placed.
        <br />
        A bet at SP is a fixed odd bet, with the odds on each selection being
        calculated and bets
        <br />
        matched when the event starts. The odds are calculated by matching SP
        backers and other
        <br />
        Exchange backers against SP layers and other Exchange layers. The
        inclusion of other
        <br />
        Exchange bets in the SP reconciliation is necessary to ensure that: SP
        backers get the benefit
        <br />
        of unmatched Exchange offers to lay if those offers could increase the
        SP; and SP layers get
        <br />
        the benefit of unmatched Exchange offers to back if those offers could
        reduce the SP. Including
        <br />
        unmatched other Exchange in the SP reconciliation also ensures that the
        bets of other
        <br />
        Exchange backers and layers, which would otherwise lapse, are matched
        where possible.
        <br />
        The minimum liability for a bet placed at SP is &pound;10 for a lay bet
        and &pound;2 for a back bet (or the
        <br />
        currency equivalent in each case).
        <br />
        Example 1: on selection A there is &pound;1,000 of backers' stakes and
        &pound;6,000 of layers' liabilities at
        <br />
        SP and there are &pound;500 of unmatched other Exchange back bets
        available to lay at an average
        <br />
        of 5.0. If we ignored the Exchange market in this case the SP would be
        7.0. However, this would
        <br />
        leave other Exchange back bets, that could also have been matched at
        their requested price
        <br />
        against SP layers, unmatched. Therefore, the SP will be 5.0 and all SP
        backers and SP layers
        <br />
        will be matched at that price. The &pound;500 of Exchange backers'
        stakes will also be matched at
        <br />
        their requested price of 5.0 against the SP layers.
        <br />
        Example 2: on selection B there are &pound;831 of backers' stakes and
        &pound;4,428 of layers' liabilities at
        <br />
        SP and the following unmatched other Exchange lay bets, available to
        back: &pound;20 at 6.8, &pound;31.13
        <br />
        at 6.6 and &pound;100 at 6.4. In this case the SP will be 6.68. This is
        calculated by including the &pound;20
        <br />
        available to back at 6.8 and the &pound;31.13 available to back at 6.6
        and balancing those amounts
        <br />
        against the SP backers' stakes and SP layers' liabilities. The
        &pound;100 available to back on the
        <br />
        Exchange at 6.4 remains unmatched as to include any of this amount would
        lead to an
        <br />
        imbalance between SP backers and SP layers.
        <br />
        The SP is calculated to six decimal places for each selection, though it
        may be displayed in the
        <br />
        relevant market view (or in any form/results data) to two decimal
        places, rounded up or down as
        <br />
        applicable. After reconciliation, the full SP on each selection is
        available by clicking on the
        <br />
        relevant individual runner graph.
        <br />
        If for whatever reason the site is unavailable when an event starts or
        the SP cannot otherwise
        <br />
        be reconciled at the 'off&rsquo;, it will determine the SP using all
        available information. For the
        <br />
        avoidance of doubt this information will not be limited to betting
        activity on the relevant
        <br />
        market(s). Also in these circumstances, a licensed betting operator
        within the group may act as
        <br />
        risk counterparty to SP bets if necessary to ensure a fair SP. The
        personnel involved in
        <br />
        determining the SP in such circumstances will have no undeclared
        personal or other interest in
        <br />
        the SP in question.
        <br />
        If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken prematurely (for example
        if a horserace is turned
        <br />
        in-play in error), then it will endeavor to reverse the reconciliation
        so that the SP is determined
        <br />
        when the event starts. There may however be circumstances in which this
        is not possible, in
        <br />
        which case the SP will be based on the initial reconciliation.
        <br />
        In cases where an SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets (including SP
        limit bets), 'At In-play:
        <br />
        Take SP' bets and 'At In-play: Keep' bets will all revert to their
        status before the reconciliation;
        <br />
        and 'At In-play: Cancel' bets will either remain cancelled if not
        matched as part of the
        <br />
        reconciliation process, or if matched as part of the reconciliation
        process, will revert to their
        <br />
        unmatched status before the reconciliation.
        <br />
        If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than scheduled
        (i.e. after the event has
        <br />
        started) and determines that a material event has occurred (this will
        generally mean that the
        <br />
        event is not turned in-play), the SP will be determined based solely on
        SP bets (and &lsquo;At In-play:
        <br />
        Take SP&rsquo; bets which are unmatched when suspends the relevant
        market), placed before the
        <br />
        'off'. This means that &lsquo;At In-play: Take SP&rsquo; bets matched
        after the off, will be made void and not
        <br />
        included in the reconciliation process. In addition, SP bets placed
        after the 'off' will be voided.
        <br />
        However, if the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than
        scheduled but determines that
        <br />
        no material event has occurred, all bets will stand.
        <br />
        If a SP 'each way' option is offered this will be processed as two
        separate bets: a win bet at SP
        <br />
        and a 'to be placed' bet at SP.
        <br />
        If for any reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to a market going
        in-play, then any
        <br />
        unmatched bets that have been selected to 'At In-play: Take SP' will be
        converted to SP bets.
        <br />
        Once those bets are converted, they cannot be cancelled.
        <br />
        &#10146; Party against whom you are betting at SP
        <br />
        When you place a bet at SP you are betting against other customers.
        However, during the
        <br />
        reconciliation of the SP, it acts as counterparty in order to balance
        liabilities between SP bets
        <br />
        and other Exchange bets
        <br />
        &#10146; Placing a SP bet
        <br />
        Selecting the 'SP' button in the market view gives customers two
        different ways to request an
        <br />
        SP bet. These are as follows:
        <br />
        The first way to request a bet at SP is by leaving the 'Set SP odds
        limit' box unticked at the top
        <br />
        right of the bet manager. For a back bet you are required to enter the
        stake you wish to bet on
        <br />
        the selection. For a lay bet, you are required to enter the liability
        you are prepared to risk against
        <br />
        the selection &ndash; in other words the amount that you are prepared to
        lose, should the selection win
        <br />
        (or be placed as applicable).
        <br />
        The second way to request a bet at SP is to select the 'Set SP odds
        limit' option. Using this you
        <br />
        can request a bet at SP conditional upon minimum SP odds in the case of
        a back bet, or
        <br />
        maximum SP odds in the case of a lay bet. If SP is shorter than the
        minimum price requested by
        <br />
        a backer or is longer than the maximum price requested by a layer, then
        the relevant bet will
        <br />
        lapse when the event starts. If SP is longer than the minimum price
        requested by a backer or is
        <br />
        shorter than the maximum price requested by a layer, the bet will be
        matched at the SP. Where
        <br />
        an SP is equal to the price limit specified by customers, those bets
        will be included based on the
        <br />
        time they were submitted, on a first come, first served basis as is the
        existing convention for
        <br />
        other Exchange bets. This means that such bets may be unmatched or
        partially matched.
        <br />
        Please note that if a non-runner cannot be removed from the relevant
        market until after the
        <br />
        completion of the event, the application to all bets matched at or
        before the &quot;off&quot; (including SP
        <br />
        bets) of any reduction factor, may mean that the matched price for an SP
        back bet with an odds
        <br />
        limit requested, is adjusted to a price below the lower limit requested.
        It may also mean that an
        <br />
        SP lay bet request with maximum odds requested, may not be matched even
        though the odds
        <br />
        on the selection, after any post-race adjustment for the late
        non-runner, is below the maximum
        <br />
        odds requested.
        <br />
        If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the minimum/maximum odds
        requested can be
        <br />
        shortened in the case of a back bet or a lengthened in the case of a lay
        bet at any time before
        <br />
        the event starts. However, as mentioned above, an SP bet request cannot
        actually be cancelled
        <br />
        by a customer once it has been placed. Details of the impact of
        non-runners on the SP re
        <br />
        provided below.
        <br />
        &#10146; Exchange bets which are unmatched at the 'off'
        <br />
        A normal Exchange bet is placed by choosing the odds of your selection
        from the market view
        <br />
        (as opposed to clicking on the 'SP' of your selection). When such an
        Exchange bet is fully or
        <br />
        partially unmatched it can be adjusted and cancelled in the normal
        course. Previously,
        <br />
        unmatched bets were automatically cancelled when a market was suspended
        at the 'off' of the
        <br />
        relevant event. You can now choose to either have your unmatched
        Exchange bet convert to an
        <br />
        SP bet when the market suspends at the start of the event, or to have
        the bet 'persist' when the
        <br />
        event goes in-play (see the 'keep' option below).
        <br />
        In order to convert your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP bet when the
        market suspends you
        <br />
        should select the 'At In-Play: Take SP' option in the bet manager. If
        there is a non-runner in a<br />
        win market with a reduction factor of at least 2.5%, or a non-runner in
        a place market with a<br />
        reduction factor of at least 4%, it is policy to cancel unmatched lay
        bets on all other runners in
        <br />
        the market. In the case of any such non-runner, instead of being
        cancelled a lay bet for which
        <br />
        the 'At In-Play: Take SP' option has been selected, will automatically
        convert to an SP bet. After
        <br />
        this conversion, the bet cannot be cancelled. Otherwise, unlike an SP
        bet, you can choose to
        <br />
        cancel an Exchange bet once it has been placed, even if you have chosen
        for the bet to persist
        <br />
        or to convert to an SP bet at the start of the event.
        <br />
        If you choose to convert an unmatched Exchange lay bet to an SP bet, the
        liability of your
        <br />
        Exchange lay bet will be converted into a liability for the SP bet. Your
        liability for that SP bet will
        <br />
        never be more than the liability for the Exchange bet you had specified.
        However, the amount
        <br />
        you can win on the SP lay bet may differ from the amount you would have
        won had the
        <br />
        Exchange bet been matched, depending on the final SP.
        <br />
        &#10146; Adjustments to SP bets for non-runners
        <br />
        For SP back bets, will at no point amend either the stake or the odds
        requested by a customer,
        <br />
        despite any non-runners or withdrawals. However, customers who have
        selected the SP limit
        <br />
        option can reduce the minimum SP odds they are prepared to accept on a
        selection.
        <br />
        For SP lay bets on win markets, it will reduce a customer's liability
        based on the reduction
        <br />
        factor(s) of any non-runner(s) and the reduction factor of the runner on
        which the customer's bet
        <br />
        has been placed. This is to ensure that the balance between the backers'
        stakes and the layers'
        <br />
        liability reflects the revised market after the runner has been removed.
        For example, if a horse
        <br />
        with a 50% reduction factor becomes a non-runner, then another horse in
        the same market
        <br />
        priced at about 5 (i.e. a reduction factor of 20%) will change to a
        price of about 2.5. Therefore,
        <br />
        the liability on a &pound;200 lay bet on that runner will need to change
        to a liability of about &pound;75 to
        <br />
        ensure that a balancing back bet will have the same &pound;50 stake.
        This is done by multiplying the
        <br />
        liability by 37.5% (i.e. 100%-(50%/ (100%-20%))).
        <br />
        Where an SP lay bet in a win market has a maximum odds limit specified,
        this limit will be
        <br />
        reduced by the reduction factor of any non-runner, if the non-runner has
        a reduction factor of at
        <br />
        least 2.5%.
        <br />
        For SP lay bets on place markets, it will still reduce a customer's
        liability based on the reduction
        <br />
        factor(s) of any non-runner(s) but the calculation will be slightly
        different, in line with the
        <br />
        application of place market reduction factors. The liability will be
        reduced by the reduction factor
        <br />
        of the removed runner. Where the lay bet on a place market has a maximum
        odds limit
        <br />
        specified, the potential winnings on the bet (i.e. the odds &ndash; 1)
        will be reduced by the reduction
        <br />
        factor of the removed runner.
        <br />
        Where an SP lay bet in a place market has a maximum odds limit specified
        this limit will be
        <br />
        reduced by the reduction factor of any non-runner.
        <br />
        SP lay bets will not be cancelled when there is a non-runner.
        <br />
        &#10146; Specific conditions for SP bets for non-runners in greyhound
        racing markets
        <br />
        ALL SP bets will stand so long as your trap selection is not vacant or
        after your bet placement a<br />
        reserve runner is not subsequently entered to run from your trap
        selection.
        <br />
        ALL unmatched &lsquo;Convert to SP&rsquo; bets will be cancelled when a
        reserve is added or a vacant trap
        <br />
        removed.
        <br />
        11. 'Keep' bets option
        <br />
        For markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the 'off', a
        customer can request that an
        <br />
        unmatched Exchange bet should not be cancelled when the market is turned
        in-play. This is
        <br />
        done by selecting the 'At In-Play: Keep' option in the bet manager (and
        confirming that request)
        <br />
        and means that the unmatched bet persists when other unmatched bets are
        cancelled at the
        <br />
        start of the event.
        <br />
        As described above, when a non-runner is removed from a horseracing
        market (apart for late
        <br />
        withdrawals as described in the next bullet point below), it is policy
        to cancel unmatched offers
        <br />
        to lay all other horses in the market if the non-runner has a reduction
        factor of 2.5% or greater
        <br />
        for win markets, or 4.0% or greater for place markets. In these
        circumstances offers to lay a<br />
        horse with the 'At In-Play: Keep' option selected will not be cancelled.
        Instead the lay odds
        <br />
        offered in place markets will be reduced in proportion with the
        reduction factors of any
        <br />
        non-runner(s) and the same will apply in win markets providing the
        relevant non-runner has a<br />
        reduction factor of at least 2.5%.
        <br />
        When there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to remove the
        non-runner from the market
        <br />
        before turning it in-play. In such cases if can determine that the late
        withdrawal is a material
        <br />
        runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 20% or
        greater in the win market), it
        <br />
        reserves the right to cancel ALL lay 'keep' bets (in both the win and
        &lsquo;to be placed&rsquo; markets)
        <br />
        before turning the market in-play. If it does not cancel lay 'keep' bets
        in the case of a late
        <br />
        withdrawal (for example, it may not be possible to know which horse is
        withdrawn, at the time of
        <br />
        the off), any such bets placed before the off and matched in-play will
        remain at the original
        <br />
        selected price. This means that those lay 'keep' bets will not be
        subject to any reduction factor
        <br />
        which as a result of the late withdrawal, will be applied after the
        completion of the race to bets
        <br />
        matched at or before the 'off'.
        <br />
        Otherwise, in exceptional cases reserves the right to cancel 'keep' bets
        to protect customers
        <br />
        but, unless stipulated in the market rules or the market information,
        the general principle is that
        <br />
        at no point will a 'keep' bet be cancelled by unless it remains
        unmatched when the market is
        <br />
        closed (for the final time) at the end of the event.
        <br />
        For the avoidance of doubt this means that (for example) when a Material
        Event occurs in a<br />
        soccer match and other unmatched bets are cancelled before the market is
        reopened, a keep
        <br />
        bet will not be cancelled.
        <br />
        12. Rules for Tote betting
        <br />
        When you place a Tote bet on the platform (for example a UK or South
        African Tote bet), you
        <br />
        are betting against as counterparty to your bet. I will then strike a
        corresponding bet into the
        <br />
        relevant Tote pool as applicable.
        <br />
        A link to the rules which apply to Tote bets struck as counterparty is
        provided within each of the
        <br />
        relevant. If there is any conflict between those rules and either: the
        equivalent rules available on
        <br />
        the relevant Tote website (for example on the UK Tote website in the
        case of UK Tote bets); or
        <br />
        the equivalent rules applied by the relevant host racetrack, the rules
        on the relevant Tote
        <br />
        website or applied by the relevant host racetrack, will prevail.
        <br />
        13. Miscellaneous
        <br />
        All references to time periods in the Exchange Rules relate to the time
        zone in which the event
        <br />
        takes place. For example, a reference to the start time of a football
        match, relates to the local
        <br />
        kick-off time.
        <br />
        All information is done so in good faith. However, it cannot accept
        liability for any errors or
        <br />
        omissions in respect of any information, such as the posting of prices,
        runners, times, scores,
        <br />
        results or general statistics.
        <br />
        It reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall take all
        reasonable steps to ensure
        <br />
        markets are administered with integrity and transparency.
        <br />
        If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding minor
        spelling mistakes) or the
        <br />
        incorrect number of teams, competitors or outcomes is displayed in any
        complete market or a<br />
        market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information (for example the
        application of an
        <br />
        incorrect exposure algorithm or a cross matching tool utilising an
        incorrect algorithm) or includes
        <br />
        any obvious error such as the incorrect deployment of the cross matching
        tool, then It reserves
        <br />
        the right to suspend the market and (providing it acts reasonably) to
        void all bets matched on
        <br />
        the market.
        <br />
        Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy themselves that
        the selection on which
        <br />
        they place a bet is their intended selection. For example, in the case
        of a competitor bearing the
        <br />
        same name as another individual not competing in the relevant event, the
        onus is on the
        <br />
        customer to ensure that they know which competitor It has loaded into
        the relevant market and
        <br />
        to ensure that they are placing their bet on their chosen competitor.
        <br />
        It reserves the right at any time in its sole and absolute discretion to
        suspend an Exchange
        <br />
        market.
        <br />
        It may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend betting
        on a market at any time
        <br />
        (even if such suspension is earlier than anticipated by the Exchange
        Rules). In the interests of
        <br />
        maintaining integrity and fairness in the markets, it may also void
        certain bets in a market or void
        <br />
        a whole market in its entirety.
        <br />
        It reserves the right to amend the Exchange Rules at any time.
        <br />
        It reserves the right to cancel unmatched bets to protect customers at
        any time.
        <br />
        On the settlement of any market, amounts relating to
        <br />
        winnings/losses on bets; and
        <br />
        commission charges
        <br />
        will be rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places (with the
        exception that rounding
        <br />
        will always be down (and never up) in respect of amounts relating to
        winnings/losses in respect
        <br />
        of BSP bets). By way of example, &pound;3.333, will be settled as
        &pound;3.33, whereas &pound;3.335, will be
        <br />
        settled as &pound;3.34 (except that it will be settled as &pound;3.33 in
        respect of an amount relating to
        <br />
        winnings/losses in respect of BSP bets).
        <br />
        The Exchange Rules have been prepared in various languages other than
        English for reference
        <br />
        only. In the event of any differences between the English version and
        the non-English version,
        <br />
        the English version shall prevail.
        <br />
        Part C - Specific sports rules
        <br />
        1. American Football
        <br />
        All markets will be settled on the result including overtime unless
        stated otherwise in these
        <br />
        American Football Rules or in the Market Information (e.g. the half
        time/full time market) or
        <br />
        where the market has been unconditionally determined. If the game
        results in a tie after
        <br />
        overtime all bets on the outright match winner market will be void.
        <br />
        If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date and is not
        completed within three days
        <br />
        of the scheduled completion date, all bets will be void except for those
        on markets which have
        <br />
        been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed, then within three
        days of the scheduled
        <br />
        start date:(a) at least 55 minutes of play must have elapsed; or (b) an
        official result must be
        <br />
        'called' by the relevant governing body; otherwise all bets will be
        void, except for those on
        <br />
        markets which have been unconditionally determined. In those instances,
        if the scores are tied
        <br />
        then all bets on the outright match winner market will be void.
        <br />
        For 'Individual player' markets, bets shall be void on any player who
        does not start in any down
        <br />
        during the match.
        <br />
        2. Athletics
        <br />
        Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled on the
        official result of the
        <br />
        relevant governing body at the time of the ceremony, regardless of any
        subsequent
        <br />
        disqualification or amendment to the result.
        <br />
        If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be determined in
        accordance with the official
        <br />
        result of the relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
        disqualification or
        <br />
        amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24
        hours of the initial
        <br />
        settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in
        reporting the result).
        <br />
        Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, if a track or field
        event is abandoned,
        <br />
        cancelled or postponed and not completed within 7 days of the scheduled
        completion date, all
        <br />
        bets will be void except for those on markets which have been
        unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        3. Australian Rules Football
        <br />
        Bets apply to regular time excluding overtime. However, bets on
        &quot;Finals&quot; matches apply to
        <br />
        regular time including overtime except for those on markets which have
        been unconditionally
        <br />
        determined or as stated otherwise in the Market Information (e.g.
        half-time/full-time markets). If
        <br />
        the game results in a tie, dead-heat rules apply to bets on the match
        odds market.
        <br />
        If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date and is not
        completed within three days
        <br />
        of the scheduled start date, all bets will be void except for those on
        markets which have been
        <br />
        unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        If a match starts but is abandoned or postponed before half-time and not
        completed within three
        <br />
        days of the scheduled start date then the match shall be deemed to be a
        tie and settled on
        <br />
        dead-heat rules. If a match starts but is abandoned or postponed in the
        second half and not
        <br />
        completed within three days of the scheduled start date then the match
        shall be settled on the
        <br />
        official result of the relevant governing body. In both instances, bets
        on the match odds market
        <br />
        will be settled as set out above and all other bets will be void except
        for those on markets which
        <br />
        have been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        All bets relating to any individual player will stand if they are listed
        in any 22-player squad on the
        <br />
        match day, irrespective of whether they take any part in the match or
        not.
        <br />
        4. Baseball
        <br />
        These Baseball Rules apply to Major League Baseball (MLB), World
        Baseball Classic and
        <br />
        Japanese Baseball only. All other baseball, including Finnish Baseball
        for example, will be
        <br />
        governed by the rules set out in the General Rules and the Market
        Information.
        <br />
        If a match does not start on the scheduled starting date, all bets will
        be void.
        <br />
        If an MLB match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and an
        official result is not declared
        <br />
        within three days of the scheduled start date, all bets will be void,
        except for those on markets
        <br />
        which have been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        If a Japanese Baseball match starts but is later abandoned or postponed
        and the match is not
        <br />
        completed within three days of the scheduled start date, all bets will
        be void except for those on
        <br />
        markets which have been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        All bets will include extra innings, unless otherwise stated in the
        Market Information.
        <br />
        All bets on 'Total runs' or 'Run line' markets will be void unless there
        have been at least 9<br />
        innings completed (8 1/2 if the home team is ahead) except those on
        market which have been
        <br />
        unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        In &quot;Listed&quot; markets, bets will be void unless both named
        pitchers listed in the market start as
        <br />
        pitchers in the first fielding innings for their respective teams.
        <br />
        5. Basketball
        <br />
        Bets will be settled on the result including overtime unless stated
        otherwise in the Market
        <br />
        Information or where the market has been unconditionally determined or
        as set out in these
        <br />
        Basketball rules.
        <br />
        If a match does not start on the scheduled start date then all bets will
        be void.
        <br />
        If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed then, within three
        days of the scheduled
        <br />
        start date, (a) at least 43 minutes of play must have elapsed in any NBA
        match or 35 minutes of
        <br />
        play must have elapsed in any other match; or (b) an official result
        must be 'called' by the
        <br />
        relevant governing body; otherwise all bets will be void, except for
        those on markets which have
        <br />
        been unconditionally determined. In these instances, if the scores are
        tied then dead heat rules
        <br />
        will apply to bets on the outright match winner market.
        <br />
        6. Boxing and Mixed Martial Arts
        <br />
        All individual bout markets will be settled according to the official
        result of the relevant governing
        <br />
        body immediately after the end of the fight, regardless of any
        subsequent disqualification or
        <br />
        amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24
        hours of the initial
        <br />
        settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in
        tallying the points or in order to
        <br />
        correct an error in reporting the result).
        <br />
        If a fight is abandoned, cancelled or postponed and not completed within
        three days of the
        <br />
        scheduled start date, or a boxer is withdrawn or substituted before the
        first-round bell, all bets
        <br />
        will be void.
        <br />
        If a boxer retires before the start of a round, fails to answer the
        bell, or is disqualified for any
        <br />
        reason between rounds, the fight will be deemed to have finished at the
        end of the previous
        <br />
        round.
        <br />
        If one of the boxers is disqualified they will be deemed a loser.
        <br />
        If the scheduled duration of the fight is altered in time or number of
        rounds after the loading of
        <br />
        the relevant markets, then all bets will be void.
        <br />
        If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been loaded so
        that the new venue is
        <br />
        changed to a venue in a different country then all bets will be void.
        For all other changes to the
        <br />
        scheduled venue bets will stand.
        <br />
        In mixed martial arts, if a fight is declared a 'no contest', a draw or
        a technical draw then all bets
        <br />
        will be void.

        those on any market that has been unconditionally determined (e.g. in
        the 'Completed Match'
        <br />
        market).
        <br />
        If a match is shortened by weather, all bets will be settled according
        to the official result
        <br />
        (including for limited overs matches, the result determined by the
        Duckworth Lewis method).
        <br />
        In the event of a match being decided by a bowl-off or toss of the coin,
        all bets will be void

        vandalism; strike or
        <br />
        boycott; crowd protests/violence; stadium damage; acts of terrorism; and

        markets which have been unconditionally determined or where the minimum
        number of overs
        <br />
        have been bowled as laid out in the market specific information.
        <br />
        In the event of a new toss taking place on a scheduled reserve day for a
        limited over match all
        <br />
        bets that were placed after 30 minutes before the original scheduled
        start of play on the first day
        <br />
        will be made void. This rule relates to all markets except those that
        have been unconditionally
        <br />
        determined (e.g. in the win the toss and toss combination markets).

        &#10146; Super Over rule
        <br />
        Which team will win this Super Over? This market will be suspended on
        site and activated once
        <br />
        Betfair are aware a Super Over is to be played. The market will be
        turned in-play at the start of
        <br />
        the Super Over. This market will not be actively managed therefore it is
        the responsibility of all
        <br />
        customers to manage their positions. This market will be settled based
        on the number of runs
        <br />
        scored by each team in the initial Super Over. For the avoidance of
        doubt, if scores are tied at
        <br />
        the completion of both innings in the Super Over then the market will be
        settled as a Dead Heat
        <br />
        except in cases where more than one Super Over is played, where it will
        be settled on the
        <br />
        winner of the final over. Any tie breaker that may be used to determine
        a winner including but
        <br />
        not limited to higher number of boundaries, higher number of sixes,
        losing fewer wickets, coin
        <br />
        toss etc. do not count for the purposes of this market.

        All bets (excluding those struck on ante-post and Australian licensed
        markets) are placed on
        <br />
        trap numbers. Greyhound names are displayed for information purposes
        only.
        <br />
        Markets will be determined according to the official result at the time
        the track gives the result
        <br />
        green light status, either in the form of an announcement or by display.
        Subsequent
        <br />
        disqualifications, appeals or amendments to the result will be
        disregarded.
        <br />
        If a non-runner or reserve runner is declared, then all bets prior to
        the update of the market on It
        <br />
        will be void and all unmatched bets including &lsquo;Take SP&rsquo; and
        &lsquo;keep&rsquo; bets will be cancelled (except
        <br />
        for certain SP bets as set out in Paragraph 10.5 of Part B above).

        It, all bets will be void.
        <br />
        In ante-post markets, all bets on individual greyhounds stand whether
        the greyhound runs or
        <br />
        not. All ante-post bets will be void if the competition is abandoned or
        the venue is changed.
        <br />
        &#10146; Trap Challenge
        <br />
        Bets on 'Trap challenge' markets are based on which trap results in the
        most winners during a<br />
        race meeting, unless stated otherwise in the Market Information.
        <br />
        These markets are unaffected by any changes due to non-runners or
        reserve runners.
        <br />
        If a race results in a dead heat each trap will receive a half-win, with
        a 3-way dead heat giving a<br />
        one third-win, and so on.
        <br />
        Standard dead heat rules apply if two or more traps have an equal number
        of winners at the end
        <br />
        of both meetings.
        <br />
        If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if at least
        one race has been
        <br />
        completed then bets on these markets will stand.

        <br />
        multiplied by the second trap for each race during a race meeting,
        unless stated otherwise in the
        <br />
        Market Information. If the cumulative sum is not a round number then
        that sum shall be rounded
        <br />
        up to give the applicable cumulative sum.
        <br />
        These markets are unaffected by any changes due to non-runners or
        reserve runners.
        <br />
        If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned or if there is only one
        finisher in a race, an eight
        <br />
        runner-greyhound races will be allocated 20 points and all other races
        will be allocated 12
        <br />
        points.
        <br />
        If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void however if at least
        one race has been
        <br />
        completed then bets on these markets will stand with the remaining races
        allocated 20 points for
        <br />
        eight runner greyhound races and 12 points for all other races.
        <br />
        Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.
        <br />
        If there is a dead heat for the winner between two greyhounds then to
        calculate the applicable
        <br />
        multi-trap number for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds
        involved in the dead heat
        <br />
        will be multiplied by each other to give the applicable multi-trap
        number.
        <br />
        If there is a dead heat for the winner between three or more greyhounds
        then to calculate the
        <br />
        applicable multi-trap number for that race the trap numbers for the
        greyhounds involved in the
        <br />
        dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of greyhounds
        involved in the dead heat
        <br />
        and the resulting number will be multiplied by itself to give the
        applicable multi-trap number
        <br />
        (even if not a round number). By way of example: traps 1, 3 and 6 dead
        heat for first. Add these
        <br />
        numbers up gives 10; divide this number by the number of greyhounds in
        the dead heat (3)
        <br />
        which gives a resulting number of 3.33; multiply 3.33 by itself to give
        11.11.
        <br />
        If there is a dead heat for the runner up between two or more greyhounds
        then to calculate the
        <br />
        applicable multi-trap number for that race the trap numbers for the
        greyhounds involved in the
        <br />
        dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of greyhounds
        involved in the dead heat
        <br />
        and the resulting number will be multiplied by the number of the winner
        to give the applicable
        <br />
        multi-trap number (even if not a round number). By way of example: trap
        1 wins and traps 3 and
        <br />
        6 dead heat for second. Adding the numbers of the dead heating runners
        up gives 9; divide this
        <br />
        number by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat (2) which gives a
        resulting number of
        <br />
        4.5; multiple 4.5 by the winning number (1) to give 4.5.
        <br />
        &#10146; Winning Distances
        <br />
        'Winning distances' bets are on the sum of the winning distances for all
        races during a race
        <br />
        meeting, unless otherwise stated in the Market Information.
        <br />
        The maximum winning distance in any race is 10 lengths.
        <br />
        If there is only one finisher in any race the winning distance will be
        deemed to be 10 lengths.
        <br />
        If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned the winning distance will be
        deemed to be 2 lengths.
        <br />
        Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.
        <br />
        For distances below half a length, the following scale will be applied:
        Short-head 0.1; Head 0.2;
        <br />
        Neck 0.3.
        <br />
        The sum of all the winning distances will be rounded to the nearest
        whole number at the end of
        <br />
        the meeting (rounded up, if half) and bets will be settled on this
        result.
        <br />
        If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if at least
        one race has been
        <br />
        completed then the remaining races are allocated 2 lengths each and bets
        will stand.
        <br />
        &#10146; Match Bets
        <br />
        'Match Bets' for a race are determined by the greyhound with the highest
        finishing position in
        <br />
        that race. If neither greyhound finishes the race bets are void. If only
        one of the greyhounds
        <br />
        finishes the race, that greyhound will be deemed the winner. If a
        non-runner or reserve runner is
        <br />
        declared then all bets will be void.
        <br />
        'Match Bets' for progress in a competition are determined by the
        greyhound which qualifies to
        <br />
        the furthest round (whether it runs in the further round or not). If the
        greyhounds concerned fail
        <br />
        to qualify in the same round of the competition then the market will be
        settled as a dead heat,
        <br />
        irrespective of their finishing positions in their individual heats.
        <br />
        &#10146; Reverse Forecasts
        <br />
        'Reverse Forecast' markets are determined by those greyhounds placed
        first and second in a<br />
        race.
        <br />
        If a dead heat affects the reverse forecast then dead heat rules apply.
        <br />
        &#10146; Place markets
        <br />
        The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in the
        Market Information and is
        <br />
        determined with reference to the number of runners when the market is
        loaded.
        <br />
        Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets (as set out
        in the Market
        <br />
        Information) will not be affected by further non-runners. If the number
        of potential winners is
        <br />
        equal to or is greater than the number of runners, all bets in this
        market will be void.
        <br />
        &#10146; To Reach the Final and To Qualify markets
        <br />
        'Reach the Final' markets shall be determined by the first six
        greyhounds who qualify from the
        <br />
        Semi Finals of the competition and be settled as such regardless of
        whether they go on to run in
        <br />
        the final or not.
        <br />
        'To qualify' markets shall be determined by the greyhounds that qualify
        in the relevant heats
        <br />
        irrespective of whether they run in the next round or not.
        <br />
        The 'reach the final' or 'to qualify' markets will be settled after the
        qualifying stages and any
        <br />
        subsequent disqualification or amendment to results will not count.
        <br />
        &#10146; Ante-post
        <br />
        If a greyhound listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the
        available information to
        <br />
        determine the time of the greyhound's death. It will then, acting
        reasonably, determine whether
        <br />
        the greyhound was a 'material runner' in the market. In determining
        whether a greyhound is a<br />
        material runner, it will look at the general price of the greyhound
        immediately before the
        <br />
        greyhound's death, in the market and in the wider betting market.
        Broadly, it will consider a<br />
        greyhound to be a material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate
        chance of winning of
        <br />
        8-10 per cent or better.
        <br />
        If It determines that the greyhound was a 'material runner', then all
        bets struck in the market (on
        <br />
        all selections) between the time of death and the suspension of the
        market will be void and all
        <br />
        unmatched bets will be cancelled before the market is reopened.
        <br />
        If It determines that the greyhound was not a 'material runner', then
        just bets struck on the
        <br />
        greyhound in question between the time of death and the suspension of
        the market will be void
        <br />
        and unmatched bets will not be cancelled before the market is reopened.
        <br />
        Bets matched on greyhounds after they have forfeited their entry at a
        particular entry stage or
        <br />
        where they have not qualified by the applicable qualifying date will be
        voided unless the race in
        <br />
        question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.
        <br />
        Where an event is postponed or rescheduled to another day at the same
        venue then ante-post
        <br />
        bets will stand unless entries are reopened in which case all bets will
        be void.
        <br />
        &#10146; Australian Specific Non-Runner Rules
        <br />
        Notwithstanding any of the above, the following rules apply to declared
        non-runners in
        <br />
        Australian greyhound markets.
        <br />
        If a greyhound becomes a notified non-runner after the market is loaded
        but prior to the
        <br />
        commencement of the race it will be removed and all bets on the market,
        matched prior to the
        <br />
        update of the market will be voided.
        <br />
        If, following the completion of a race, the stewards declare a greyhound
        a non-runner, it will
        <br />
        resettle the market and will void all bets that were placed on that
        runner only. It will then apply a<br />
        reduction factor to all bets placed on the winner (or place getters in
        the case of place markets)
        <br />
        based on that runner&rsquo;s weighted average price.
        <br />
        14. Horseracing
        <br />
        &#10146; General
        <br />
        All individual race markets will be determined according to the official
        result at the time of the
        <br />
        'weigh-in' announcement (or equivalent). Subsequent disqualifications,
        appeals or amendments
        <br />
        to the result will be disregarded.
        <br />
        If a race is abandoned or otherwise declared void, or in the event of a
        walkover, all bets on that
        <br />
        race will be void.
        <br />
        If the scheduled venue is changed after the market has been loaded, all
        bets will be void.
        <br />
        Where a race does not take part on its scheduled day, all bets will be
        void.
        <br />
        If a scheduled surface type is changed (e.g. turf to dirt) all bets will
        stand.
        <br />
        Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on &lsquo;day of the
        race&rsquo; markets (and not ante-post
        <br />
        markets). Horseracing ante-post rules do not therefore apply in relation
        to horseracing
        <br />
        Exchange Multiples.
        <br />
        &#10146; Ante-post
        <br />
        Subject to the points below, in ante-post markets, all bets on an
        individual horse stand whether
        <br />
        the horse runs or not.
        <br />
        For GB and Irish racing: if a horse is balloted out, all bets on that
        horse will be void.
        <br />
        If a horse listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the available
        information to determine the
        <br />
        time of the horse's death. It will be acting reasonably, determine
        whether the horse was a<br />
        'material runner' in the market. It will undertake a similar
        determination in cases where it is
        <br />
        advised through official channels that a runner has been formally
        scratched from an ante-post
        <br />
        race. In determining whether a horse is a material runner, it will
        consider the general price of the
        <br />
        horse immediately before the horse's death (or immediately before being
        advised it has been
        <br />
        scratched), in the market and in the wider betting market. Broadly, it
        will consider a horse to be a<br />
        material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate chance of winning
        of 8-10 per cent or
        <br />
        better.
        <br />
        If it determines that the horse was a 'material runner', then all bets
        struck in the market (on all
        <br />
        selections) between the time of death (or the time that the formal
        scratching notification was
        <br />
        created) and the suspension of the market will be void and all unmatched
        bets will be cancelled
        <br />
        before the market is reopened.
        <br />
        If it determines that the horse was not a 'material runner', then just
        bets struck on the horse in
        <br />
        question between the time of death (or the time that the formal
        scratching notification was
        <br />
        created) and the suspension of the market will be void and unmatched
        bets will not be cancelled
        <br />
        before the market is reopened.
        <br />
        Bets matched on horses after they have forfeited their entry at a
        particular entry stage or where
        <br />
        they have not qualified by the applicable qualifying date will be voided
        unless the race in
        <br />
        question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.
        <br />
        Please be aware that runners who have not been entered at the various
        entry stages may be
        <br />
        removed from relevant race markets and all matched customer bet prices
        set to 1.0 even if there
        <br />
        are later supplementary stages. Should it appear likely that a specific
        runner may actually be
        <br />
        supplemented into the race this runner will be reinstated with all
        matched customer bets set
        <br />
        back to the original prices.
        <br />
        No Non-Runner Rule' reductions are made to ante-post bets.
        <br />
        All relevant bets will be void where an event is: abandoned and not
        rescheduled; or postponed
        <br />
        and rescheduled to another venue; or postponed and rescheduled to
        another day at the same
        <br />
        venue with entries for the race being reopened or reverting back to a
        previous entry or
        <br />
        declaration stage provided any additional horses are entered or
        re-entered and such entries or
        <br />
        declarations are considered, in absolute discretion, material to the
        betting on the race. For the
        <br />
        avoidance of doubt, where a race is postponed and rescheduled to another
        day at the same
        <br />
        venue, relevant bets will stand where entries/declarations at the time
        of postponement remain
        <br />
        unaltered or include any non-material addition(s) prior to the
        rescheduled race.
        <br />
        &#10146; Place Terms for Exchange markets
        <br />
        The number of winners in 'to be placed' markets is as set out in the
        Market Information and is
        <br />
        determined with reference to the number of runners when the market is
        loaded.
        <br />
        Once opened, the number of winners in 'to be placed' markets will not be
        affected by further
        <br />
        non-runners.
        <br />
        If the number of winners stated in the Market Information is equal to or
        is greater than the
        <br />
        number of runners, all bets in this market will be void.
        <br />
        If the number of placed horses is less than the number of potential
        winners listed in the Market
        <br />
        Information, the winners will only be the placed horse or horses.
        <br />
        &#10146; EW markets
        <br />
        The place portion of any &quot;Each Way&quot; bet will be settled
        according to the number of 'places' and
        <br />
        at the fraction of the win portion profit stated in the market
        information.
        <br />
        For example: &ldquo;EW Terms: 1/5th odds, 3 places&rdquo;. That
        &ldquo;1/5th&rdquo; is applied to the traditional or
        <br />
        fractional odds, which are 1 less than decimal odds, so the calculation
        of the Place odds
        <br />
        corresponding to Win odds of 8.0 in this market is ((8.0 &ndash; 1) / 5)
        + 1 = 2.4.
        <br />
        Once opened, the number of places in 'EW&rdquo; markets will not be
        affected by further non-runners
        <br />
        unless the number of &lsquo;places&rsquo; which are offered on the
        &lsquo;Each Way&rsquo; market is equal to or exceeds
        <br />
        the number of runners in which case, the place portion of any EW bet
        will be voided at
        <br />
        settlement.
        <br />
        &#10146; Winning Distance Bets
        <br />
        Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, winning distances'
        bets are on the sum of the
        <br />
        winning distances from each race on one particular day at a race
        meeting.
        <br />
        The winning distance in a race will be the officially declared distance
        between the first two
        <br />
        horses past the post. However, if either the first or second horse past
        the post is disqualified
        <br />
        because: (i) of an incorrect weight carried; (ii) they have taken the
        wrong course; (iii) the jockey
        <br />
        of either horse fails to weigh in, or weighs in light after the race;
        then in each case the winning
        <br />
        distance shall be that between the first and second horse under the
        official result.
        <br />
        For the purpose of this bet, the maximum distance on any individual race
        will be 12 lengths for
        <br />
        Flat races and 30 lengths for National Hunt races (which includes
        National Hunt Flat Races) and
        <br />
        these distances will be applied where only one horse finishes a race.
        For distances below half a<br />
        length, the following scale will be applied:
        <br />
        Nose: 0.05 length
        <br />
        Short-head: 0.1
        <br />
        Head: 0.2
        <br />
        Short-neck: 0.25
        <br />
        Neck: 0.3
        <br />
        If a meeting has three or more races abandoned or declared void, then
        all 'winning distance'
        <br />
        bets will be void, unless the entire market has been unconditionally
        determined.
        <br />
        When only one or two races are abandoned or declared void, then 'winning
        distance' bets will be
        <br />
        settled with a default distance used for each abandoned or void race.
        The default distances are
        <br />
        2 lengths for Flat races and 10 lengths for National Hunt races.
        <br />
        In the case of a walkover the following distances will be applied:
        <br />
        Flat: 5 lengths
        <br />
        National Hunt: 12 lengths
        <br />
        &#10146; Non-Runner Rule
        <br />
        Non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on bets already
        matched when a horse in a<br />
        race is declared a non-runner. In order to make the adjustment applies a
        reduction factor to the
        <br />
        remaining runners. The reduction factor allocated to a non-runner is a
        calculation (the details of
        <br />
        which are described below) of that horse's chances of winning (or being
        placed, etc. as
        <br />
        appropriate) and is applied to bets already matched on the other runners
        in the relevant market
        <br />
        or markets.
        <br />
        Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does not
        subsequently come under
        <br />
        starter's orders is deemed to be a non-runner.
        <br />
        When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction factor',
        based on a forecast price,
        <br />
        which is expressed as a percentage. These reduction factors may be
        updated periodically at the
        <br />
        discretion based on trading in the market, but after approximately 15
        minutes (approximately 5<br />
        minutes for Australian and US markets) from the scheduled 'off' time of
        a given race, they will be
        <br />
        updated only in exceptional circumstances.
        <br />
        Reductions will be made to both win and place markets but applied
        differently (as described
        <br />
        below), and horses will have a different reduction factor for each
        market.
        <br />
        As soon as becomes aware that a horse is an official non-runner or a
        highly likely non-runner,
        <br />
        following a statement to the press from connections, the following will
        happen:
        <br />
        All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse will be
        removed from the market.
        <br />
        In the win market: if the reduction factor of the non-runner is 2.5% or
        greater, the traded price of
        <br />
        all the matched bets on the remaining horses will be reduced by an
        amount equal to the
        <br />
        non-runner's final reduction factor and all the unmatched offers to lay
        will be cancelled. If the
        <br />
        non-runner's reduction factor is less than 2.5%, reductions will not be
        applied and unmatched
        <br />
        bets will not be cancelled.
        <br />
        In the place market, the reduction factor of all non-runners will be
        applied (even if less than
        <br />
        2.5%) and the potential winnings in relation to matched bets on the
        remaining horses will be
        <br />
        reduced by an amount equal to the non-runner's final reduction factor.
        Only if the non-runner's
        <br />
        reduction factor is 4.0% or greater will all the unmatched offers to lay
        be cancelled.
        <br />
        All the reduction factors on the remaining horses will be adjusted to
        reflect their improved
        <br />
        chance of winning.
        <br />
        Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck in-play.
        However, if a market is turned
        <br />
        in-play prematurely by error (or, for example, there is a false start),
        all bets matched during this
        <br />
        time will be subject to any later reduction factor, provided the market
        is turned out of play before
        <br />
        the race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal, it reserves the
        right to remove the runner
        <br />
        after completion of the race. In this case only those bets matched prior
        to the off will be affected
        <br />
        by a reduction factor.
        <br />
        In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in error or
        following incorrect
        <br />
        information regarding a runner&rsquo;s participation, it will reinstate
        both the runner and all previously
        <br />
        matched bets associated with that runner. All bets made between the time
        of withdrawal and
        <br />
        reinstatement will be void in both the place market and the win market.
        The reduction factor
        <br />
        applied to matched bets at the time of withdrawal will be reversed and
        the original prices will
        <br />
        become valid.
        <br />
        Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets in the order
        in which they are
        <br />
        brought to attention. If It becomes aware of more than one non-runner at
        the same time, it will
        <br />
        remove the non-runners from the relevant markets in race card order.
        <br />
        If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or because
        of incorrect information
        <br />
        regarding a runner&rsquo;s participation, It reserve the right to
        introduce the missing runner into the
        <br />
        market at any time prior to settlement (even after the race has been
        run), provided that It has
        <br />
        determined that the missing runner is not a material runner (i.e. a
        selection with a reduction
        <br />
        factor of approx. 2.5% or less in the win market). In such
        circumstances, all pre-play unmatched
        <br />
        and matched bets will stand, however if the runner is not introduced
        before the start of the race,
        <br />
        all in-play bets will be void. However, if the missing runner is deemed
        to be a material runner,
        <br />
        then the malformed market will be void and a new market will be loaded
        where possible.
        <br />
        &#10146; How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets
        <br />
        In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded price.
        <br />
        For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the
        traded price on all previously
        <br />
        matched bets on other horses will be reduced by 25% - traded price of
        8.0 would become 6.0
        <br />
        etc. And these might be further reduced if another horse is subsequently
        declared a non-runner.
        <br />
        In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded win price. The
        advertised place terms
        <br />
        will then apply to the revised win prices.
        <br />
        For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the
        traded price on all previously
        <br />
        matched bets on other horses will be reduced by 25% - - traded price of
        8.0 would become 6.0.
        <br />
        If each Way terms were 1/5th odds for 3 places, the corresponding price
        for the Place portion of
        <br />
        the bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.
        <br />
        In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential winnings
        on the bet only, and not
        <br />
        the traded price.
        <br />
        For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the
        potential winnings on all
        <br />
        previously matched bets on the other horses will be reduced by 25% - a
        traded price of 8.0
        <br />
        would become 6.25. For example, a &pound;10 bet on a horse to be placed
        at a traded price of 8.0
        <br />
        would provide winnings of &pound;70. If there is a non-runner with a
        reduction factor of 25% in the
        <br />
        race, that factor will be applied to the &pound;70 of potential winnings
        leaving potential winnings of
        <br />
        &pound;52.50. Therefore, the revised traded price will be 6.25.
        <br />
        The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s) is
        subsequently declared a<br />
        non-runner, however odds cannot be reduced below 1.01.
        <br />
        Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant markets but will
        have a non-applicable
        <br />
        reduction factor until It has received confirmation that it is a
        confirmed runner, in which case an
        <br />
        applicable reduction factor may apply to it.
        <br />
        For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a
        non-runner replaced by a<br />
        reserve, will be applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets,
        prior to the removal from those
        <br />
        markets of such non-runner. Likewise, should a reserve runner become a
        confirmed runner but
        <br />
        subsequently become a non-runner, any reduction factor applicable to
        such non-runner will be
        <br />
        applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal
        from those markets of
        <br />
        such non-runner.
        <br />
        &#10146; Additional rules
        <br />
        Card numbers are posted as a guide only: bets are placed on a named
        horse.
        <br />
        Horses will not be coupled.
        <br />
        Where any horse(s) runs for purse money only it is deemed a non-runner
        for betting purposes.
        <br />
        Should this result in the number of possible winners stated in the
        relevant Market Information
        <br />
        being equal to or greater than the number of runners in the relevant
        market, all bets in the
        <br />
        market will be void.
        <br />
        15. Ice Hockey
        <br />
        All bets on &quot;Regular Time&quot; markets will be settled on the
        result at the end of regular time,
        <br />
        excluding overtime. All bets on &quot; Moneyline &quot; markets will be
        settled at the result at the end of
        <br />
        regular time including &quot;overtime and any shootouts that may be
        played&quot;.
        <br />
        'Puck Line' markets (i.e. handicap markets for NHL (National Hockey
        League) matches) will be
        <br />
        settled on the final result including any overtime and any shootouts
        that may be played. All
        <br />
        'handicap' markets on other matches will be settled on the result at the
        end of regular time,
        <br />
        excluding overtime.
        <br />
        If a match does not start on the scheduled start date and is not
        completed within three days of
        <br />
        the scheduled start date, all bets will be void except for those on
        markets which have been
        <br />
        unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed then, within three
        days of the scheduled
        <br />
        start date, (a) at least 55 minutes of play must have elapsed in any
        match; or (b) an official
        <br />
        result must be 'called' by the relevant governing body; otherwise all
        bets will be void, except for
        <br />
        those which have been unconditionally determined. In these instances, if
        the scores are tied
        <br />
        then for &quot; Moneyline &quot; matches (where no tie is offered) dead
        heat rules will apply to bets on the
        <br />
        outright match winner market.
        <br />
        16. Rowing
        <br />
        If a crew or individual starts a race but does not complete it then they
        will be deemed a loser
        <br />
        providing at least one other crew or individual completes the race. If
        no crew or individual
        <br />
        completes a race then all bets will be void.
        <br />
        If a regatta is cancelled for any reason, all bets will be void, except
        those on markets which
        <br />
        have been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled on the
        official result of the
        <br />
        relevant governing body at the time of the ceremony, regardless of any
        subsequent
        <br />
        disqualification or amendment to the result.
        <br />
        If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be determined in
        accordance with the official
        <br />
        result of the relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
        disqualification or
        <br />
        amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24
        hours of the initial
        <br />
        settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in
        reporting the result).
        <br />
        17. Rugby Union and Rugby League
        <br />
        'Tournament points' and 'tournament tries' bets will apply to all
        playing time, including any
        <br />
        extra-time in any match where an official result is declared.
        <br />
        For 'time of first try' bets, if the try is scored in the second half,
        the first half is deemed to have
        <br />
        lasted 40 minutes, regardless of stoppage-time. If no try is scored, or
        the try is scored in second
        <br />
        half stoppage-time or extra-time, the result is 80.
        <br />
        For the purpose of markets involving tries, penalty tries will count
        with the exception of 'first
        <br />
        individual try scorer' markets where penalty tries will not count.
        <br />
        If a match starts but is abandoned before its completion, all bets will
        be void unless an official
        <br />
        result is declared by the applicable governing body. Where an official
        result has been declared
        <br />
        by the official governing body, that official result will govern match
        and handicap market
        <br />
        settlement but all other markets will be void unless their result has
        already been determined at
        <br />
        the point of abandonment (i.e. at the point of abandonment, it would not
        have been possible for
        <br />
        the outcome of the bet to change had the match continued to its natural
        conclusion). By way of
        <br />
        example, if 37 points have been scored at the time a match is abandoned:
        (i) a bet placed on 35
        <br />
        points or more to be scored would be settled as a winning bet, (ii) a
        bet placed on 30-35 points
        <br />
        to be scored would be settled as a losing bet and (iii) a bet placed on
        40-45 points to be scored
        <br />
        would be void. In such circumstances, bets on last try scorer / team to
        score last / team to score
        <br />
        last try / last scoring play would all be void.
        <br />
        18. Snooker and Pool
        <br />
        In the event of a match starting but not being completed, the player
        progressing to the next
        <br />
        round will be deemed the winner (or in the case of the final the player
        declared the winner).
        <br />
        If a match is not completed for any reason then bets on 'any correct
        score' or 'next frame'
        <br />
        market will be void.
        <br />
        If a match is not completed for any reason, bets on any handicap market
        will be void unless the
        <br />
        market has been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        19. Soccer
        <br />
        If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a Material
        Event, it reserves the
        <br />
        right to void bets unfairly matched after the Material Event has
        occurred. Voiding of these bets
        <br />
        may take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is
        completed.
        <br />
        If a match has not started (or believes that a match will not have
        started) by 23:59 (local time)
        <br />
        on its scheduled start date, then all bets will be void unless it has
        knowledge that the match has
        <br />
        been rescheduled to be played within three days of its original start
        date.
        <br />
        If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and believes that
        the match will not have
        <br />
        been completed by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date, then
        all markets, with the
        <br />
        exception of any unconditionally determined markets, will be void unless
        it has knowledge that
        <br />
        the match has been rescheduled to be played within three days of its
        original start date. If it
        <br />
        does have knowledge that the game will be played within three days and
        the game is played
        <br />
        within three days, then all bets will stand except if the match is
        restarted from the beginning. If
        <br />
        the match is restarted from the beginning then all bets matched before
        the market went in-play
        <br />
        will stand, but any bets placed in-play will be void, except for any
        bets placed in-play on markets
        <br />
        which have been unconditionally determined, which will stand.
        <br />
        For Friendly matches, all bets apply to the full duration of play
        according to the match officials,
        <br />
        plus any stoppage time. If a friendly match starts but is later
        abandoned or postponed and is not
        <br />
        completed (i.e. the full duration of play according to match officials,
        plus any stoppage time)
        <br />
        within three days of the scheduled start date, all bets will be void
        except for those on markets
        <br />
        which have been unconditionally determined. In the case of ambiguity
        over the official result
        <br />
        from match officials, the outcome will be determined (acting reasonably)
        using information from
        <br />
        independent sources.
        <br />
        If an official fixture lists different team details to those listed (for
        example, the team name,
        <br />
        reserves, age group, gender, etc.), then all bets matched on the
        affected markets will be void. In
        <br />
        all other cases, bets will stand (including instances where a team name
        is listed without
        <br />
        specifying the term 'XI' in the name). If an official fixture is shown
        on the website under an
        <br />
        incorrect competition name, then it reserves the right to void all bets
        matched on the affected
        <br />
        markets.
        <br />
        If a team is relegated from a league because, at the end of a season, it
        has finished within the
        <br />
        relegation positions which are relevant to that league (i.e. usually any
        of the bottom three league
        <br />
        positions), bets on that team to be relegated will be settled as winning
        bets. If a team is
        <br />
        otherwise disqualified, thrown out or removed from a league (i.e. in
        circumstances other than
        <br />
        those where it has finished the season within the relevant relegation
        positions): (i) if such team
        <br />
        is disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league before the
        relevant season has started,
        <br />
        all bets on the affected market will be void (and a new market will
        subsequently be loaded) and
        <br />
        (ii) if such team is disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league
        after the relevant season
        <br />
        has started (or a determination is made by the applicable governing
        body, during the season,
        <br />
        that the team will be thrown out or removed from the league following
        the season&rsquo;s conclusion),
        <br />
        all bets on the affected team will be void. For the avoidance of doubt,
        if a points deduction is
        <br />
        imposed on a team such that it finishes the season within the relegation
        places which are
        <br />
        relevant to the applicable league, bets on that team to be relegated
        will be settled as winning
        <br />
        bets.
        <br />
        The relevant season will be deemed to have started once the first league
        game has been
        <br />
        played. For the purposes of this rule, markets relating to individual
        matches will not be deemed
        <br />
        to be &quot;affected markets&quot;.
        <br />
        'Shirt numbers' bets will refer to the shirt number allocated at the
        start of the match. 'Shirt
        <br />
        numbers' bets will include own-goal scorers. Any player whose shirt
        bears no number will be
        <br />
        allocated the number 12.
        <br />
        For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. &quot;First Goal Odds&quot;
        markets), the first half is deemed to last 45
        <br />
        minutes, regardless of stoppage time. Also for these markets, please
        note that the &quot;0 - 10
        <br />
        Minutes&quot; selection covers the first 10 minutes of the match. In
        other words, it runs from 0:00
        <br />
        until just before the clock hits 10:00. The &quot;11 &ndash; 20
        Minutes&quot; selection runs from 10:00 until just
        <br />
        before the clock hits 20:00. The same principle applies to each of the
        other selections in this
        <br />
        market.
        <br />
        For 'top goal scorer' markets only the goals scored in the league or
        competition stated in the
        <br />
        Market Information count. For example, if a player joins a club
        mid-season any goals scored in a<br />
        different league will not count, however goals scored for a different
        club in the same league will
        <br />
        count. Own goals will not count.
        <br />
        In markets which relate to the number of incidents to occur, such as
        'number of corners', these
        <br />
        will be determined on the basis of the number taken, rather than
        awarded.
        <br />
        For markets that relate to the number of bookings given, the number of
        corners taken, any goal
        <br />
        scorer or the time of a particular goal, the result will be determined
        (acting reasonably) using
        <br />
        information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new
        information comes into the
        <br />
        public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting
        reasonably) determine either: (i)
        <br />
        whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this
        new information; or (ii) to
        <br />
        wait for further information before deciding whether to reinstate or
        resettle the market. Except it
        <br />
        has announced that it is waiting for further information, any
        information that comes into the
        <br />
        public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall
        not be considered
        <br />
        (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a
        different result).
        <br />
        20. Swimming
        <br />
        Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled on the
        official result of the
        <br />
        relevant governing body at the time of the ceremony, regardless of any
        subsequent
        <br />
        disqualification or amendment to the result.
        <br />
        If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be determined in
        accordance with the official
        <br />
        result of the relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
        disqualification or
        <br />
        amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24
        hours of the initial
        <br />
        settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in
        reporting the result)
        <br />
        21. Tennis
        <br />
        If a player or pairing retires or is disqualified in any match, the
        player or pairing progressing to
        <br />
        the next round (or winning the tournament in the case of a final) will
        be deemed the winner.
        <br />
        However, if less than one set has been completed at the time of the
        retirement or
        <br />
        disqualification then all bets relating to that individual match will be
        void.
        <br />
        All bets relating to the number of occurrences of certain events within
        a tournament will be void
        <br />
        if the tournament is reduced in length, postponed or cancelled, except
        for those on markets
        <br />
        which have been unconditionally determined.
        <br />
        All bets will stand regardless of changes to scheduled venues, including
        any changes to a<br />
        different type of surface.
        <br />
        If the scheduled duration of a match is reduced or increased in the
        number of games/sets
        <br />
        required to win, all bets will be void except for those on markets which
        have been
        <br />
        unconditionally determined. Please note that this does not apply to
        &lsquo;Match Odds&rsquo; or &lsquo;Set Winner&rsquo;
        <br />
        markets on Davis Cup matches or &lsquo;dead rubber&rsquo; matches that
        have been shortened from five
        <br />
        sets to three sets after the market has been loaded, provided that the
        match has been
        <br />
        shortened in accordance with the competition&rsquo;s rules.
        <br />
        Where markets are offered on individual games or sets within a match, a
        retirement or
        <br />
        disqualification during a game or set will render bets on that game or
        set market and all
        <br />
        individual game or set markets void except those on markets which have
        been unconditionally
        <br />
        determined.
        <br />
        22. Winter sports (which may include, amongst others, Alpine Skiing,
        Biathlon, Cross-Country
        <br />
        Skiing and Ski-Jumping)
        <br />
        Where there is a presentation ceremony, markets will be settled on the
        official result of the
        <br />
        relevant governing body at the time of the ceremony, regardless of any
        subsequent
        <br />
        disqualification or amendment to the result.
        <br />
        If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be determined in
        accordance with the official
        <br />
        result of the relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
        disqualification or
        <br />
        amendment to the result (except if an amendment is announced within 24
        hours of the initial
        <br />
        settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an error in
        reporting the result).
        <br />
        Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, if an event is
        abandoned, postponed or
        <br />
        cancelled, all bets will be void unless (a) the event is completed at
        the same venue within 7<br />
        days of the official scheduled completion date; or (b) a result is
        'called' by the relevant governing
        <br />
        body.
        <br />
        The General Rules will apply for 'match bets'. However, in respect of
        &quot;Nordic Combined&quot; if all
        <br />
        competitors involved in the match bet do not start both sections of the
        event (ski jumping and
        <br />
        cross country) then bets will be void.
