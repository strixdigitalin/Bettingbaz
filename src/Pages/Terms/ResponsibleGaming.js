        customers as well as
        <br /> promoting the awareness of problem gambling and improving
        prevention* intervention and <br /> treatment.
        <br /> Bettingbaaz&rsquo;s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its
        commitment to minimizing the negative
        <br /> effects of problem gambling and to promoting responsible gambling
        practices.
        <br /> Bettingbaaz supports the generation of online gamblers offering
        them a wide range of games
        <br /> and entertainment. We also take responsibility for our product
        line-up.
        <br /> The aim of Bettingbaaz is to provide the world&rsquo;s safest and
        most innovative gaming platform for
        <br /> adults. The offered clear and safe products allow each user to
        play within his financial means
        <br /> and to receive the highest quality service. Integrity* fairness
        and reliability are the guiding
        <br /> principles of Bettingbaaz&rsquo;s work. It is therefore clear
        that Bettingbaaz should do its best to avoid
        <br /> and reduce the problems* which can arise from participation in
        gambling* particularly in cases of
        <br /> immoderate playing. At the same time it is important to respect
        the rights of those who take part
        <br /> in games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of
        entertainment.
        <br /> Responsible Gaming at Bettingbaaz is based on three fundamental
        principles: Security of the
        <br /> player* Security of the game and Protection against gaming
        addiction. Together with research
        <br /> institutes* associations and therapy institutions* we work on
        creation of a responsible* secure
        <br /> and reliable framework for online gaming.
        <br /> Player security
        <br /> We take responsibility for the security of our players.
        Protection of the players is based on
        <br /> forbidding the attendance of the minors from participation in
        games and the protection of
        <br /> privacy* which involves responsible processing of personal data
        and payments. Fairness and
        <br /> the random nature of the products offered are monitored closely
        by independent organizations.
        <br /> Marketing communication is also geared towards player protection:
        we promise only what
        <br /> players can receive in our transparent line.
        <br /> Protection against gaming addiction: research &ndash; prevention
        &ndash; intervention
        <br /> The majority of users who make sports bets* casino bets and other
        gaming offers play in
        <br /> moderation for entertainment. Certain habits and behavior
        patterns (such as shopping* playing
        <br /> sports* eating or consumption of alcohol) which are considered to
        be normal and not causing
        <br /> any concern can develop into addiction for some people and cause
        problems. In the same way*
        <br /> bets on sports and gambling can lead to problems for a small
        group of customers.
        <br /> Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further
        participation in the gaming line-up.
        <br /> Subsequently the customers are provided with contacts of
        organizations where they can receive
        <br /> professional advice and support.
        <br /> Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention
        <br /> The basic principle promoted by Bettingbaaz is that the final
        decision and responsibility on
        <br /> whether to play or not* and how much money can be spent on the
        game should be assumed by
        <br /> the customer himself.
        <br /> Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most
        effective form of protection from
        <br /> addiction. Bettingbaaz sees its responsibility in assisting the
        customers by providing transparent
        <br /> products* full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.
        <br /> Protection of minors
        <br /> Bettingbaaz does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18)
        to participate in games and
        <br /> make bets. That&rsquo;s why the confirmation of having reached
        the age of majority and the
        <br /> confirmation of date of birth are mandatory requirements during
        registration. Bettingbaaz
        <br /> considers the issue of minors taking part in games and betting
        very seriously. In order to offer
        <br /> the best possible protection of minors* we also rely on the
        support of parents and caregivers.
        <br /> Please keep your data for account access in a safe place (user ID
        and password).
        <br /> Furthermore* we would recommend that you install filter software.
        This software will allow you to
        <br /> restrict the access to Internet resources inappropriate for
        children and teenagers. These
        <br /> include:
        <br /> www.netnanny.com
        <br /> www.cybersitter.com
        <br /> Responsibility towards problems
        <br /> Bettingbaaz offers a variety of games and bets* which are forms
        of entertainment for the
        <br /> majority of customers. At the same time the company takes
        responsibility for its customers by
        <br /> providing support and tools for maintenance of a secure and
        entertaining environment taking
        <br /> into account the associated risks.
        <br /> The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks* recognizing
        their own limits or those who
        <br /> suffer from gambling addiction are not able to enjoy our product
        line-up responsibly and
        <br /> perceive it as a form of entertainment. Bettingbaaz takes
        responsibility for such users by
        <br /> blocking their access to its products for their own protection.
        <br /> Get informed with the main issues!
        <br /> Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games
        within their financial capacity is
        <br /> fully acceptable. However* for a small percentage of people
        gambling is not a form of
        <br /> entertainment* it is a challenge that must be considered
        seriously.
        <br /> What is the problematic game behavior?
        <br /> A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior*
        which interferes mode of life*
        <br /> work* financial position or health of a person or his family.
        Long participation in games is counter
        <br /> indicative to such person as it can lead to negative
        consequences.
        <br /> In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially
        recognized and enlisted in the list
        <br /> of psychological diseases of international classification system
        DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined
        <br /> as long* repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for
        game* despite of existing negative
        <br /> personal and social circumstances* such as a debt* rupture of
        family relations and delay of
        <br /> professional growth.
        <br /> In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as
        dependence?
        <br /> It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game
        dependence can be qualified only by
        <br /> experts. The material presented on this web-page will help you to
        estimate and define your own
        <br /> game behaviour.
        <br /> The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any
        substance is that it is very
        <br /> difficult to define the line between pleasure and addiction.
        Nevertheless* there are some
        <br /> diagnostic signals that may point out the existing problems. In
        the presence of at least five of the
        <br /> following symptoms* the likelihood of the severe dependence is
        high:
        <br /> The player is deeply involved in gambling* all his thoughts are
        only about the game.
        <br /> Bet sum increases in course of time.
        <br /> Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear
        to be unsuccessful.
        <br /> When limiting his participation in gambling* a person experiences
        irritation and disappointment.
        <br /> The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.
        <br /> The player tries to win back the lost amount*
        <br /> Lies about his playing behavior*
        <br /> Commits illegal acts*
        <br /> Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues*
        <br /> Borrows to participate in the games.

        anxiety:
